# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

NPC Plugin Chooser 2 (N.P.C.2) is a Windows desktop utility for Skyrim mod
users: it lets you pick which appearance mod supplies each NPC's face, then
generates an output plugin + assets (or a SkyPatcher .ini) that applies those
choices. It is the successor to the original NPC Plugin Chooser and overlaps in
purpose with EasyNPC (it can import/export EasyNPC profiles). See README.md for
the full end-user feature walkthrough and UI semantics.

## Build & run

- **IDE/SDK:** .NET 10 WPF app (`net10.0-windows10.0.19041.0`, `WinExe`). Solution:
  `NPC Plugin Chooser 2.sln`; app project `NPC Plugin Chooser 2.csproj` plus the
  test project `Tests/NPC Plugin Chooser 2.Tests.csproj`.
- **Build:** `dotnet build "NPC Plugin Chooser 2.csproj" -c Debug`
- **Run:** launch the built exe in `bin/Debug/net10.0-windows10.0.19041.0/`, or
  `dotnet run`. In production it is meant to be launched *through a mod manager*
  (MO2/Vortex).
- **Close the app before rebuilding.** A running instance locks output DLLs
  (notably `CharacterViewer.Rendering.dll`); MSB3027/MSB3021 copy-lock errors
  mean the app is still open, not a compile failure.
- **Tests:** `dotnet test "Tests/NPC Plugin Chooser 2.Tests.csproj"` (xUnit; see
  `Tests/README.md`). Many integration tests need a resolvable Skyrim SE install
  and, by repo convention, **print a SKIPPED note and return green without one**
  rather than failing — so a clean run on a machine without the game proves less
  than it looks. End-to-end behaviour against real mods is still verified
  manually; the logs below are the primary diagnostic tool for that.

### External/sibling dependencies
- **`CharacterViewer.Rendering`** — the offscreen OpenGL 3D renderer used for
  in-app mugshot generation. It lives in the SynthEBD repo and is published to
  nuget.org as **`SynthEBD.CharacterViewer.Rendering`**. The csproj reference is
  *conditional*: if the SynthEBD repo is checked out as a sibling
  (`../../SynthEBD/CharacterViewer.Rendering`) the build uses its live source (so
  it can be co-developed in place — it is in-scope for edits; change it directly);
  otherwise it restores the published NuGet package, so a fresh clone builds with
  no extra setup. When bumping the renderer, keep the csproj `PackageReference`
  version, the CV.R `<Version>`, and `CharacterViewerRendering.Version` in sync,
  and publish a new package (SynthEBD `publish-cvr.yml` workflow). Its GLSL
  shaders ship embedded in the assembly (and copied beside it for local builds)
  and must be **ASCII-only** (non-ASCII chars in comments break the compiler with
  a misleading "unexpected $end" error).
- **NPC Portrait Creator** native binaries (`NPCPortraitCreator.exe`, `glfw3`,
  `libbsarch`, shaders, `lighting.json`) are copied from
  `../../NPC Portrait Creator/out/build/x64-Release` by the csproj; the external
  portrait renderer won't work without them.
- **Mutagen.Bethesda** (Skyrim) is the core library for reading/writing
  Bethesda plugins and resolving the load order. Versions are pinned to specific
  alphas — match them when adding Mutagen calls, and verify API signatures
  against the installed package rather than guessing.

## Architecture

MVVM with **ReactiveUI** (+ `ReactiveUI.Fody` `[Reactive]` properties),
**Autofac** DI, and **Splat** for view location. `App.xaml.cs` is the
composition root: it loads `Settings`, runs `UpdateHandler` migrations, registers
everything, then resolves `VM_Settings` and runs the startup pipeline. Backend
services and the primary VMs are registered `SingleInstance()`; per-item VMs
(e.g. `VM_ModSetting`, mugshot tile VMs) are transient and created via injected
factory delegates. Themes (`Themes/*.xaml`) are loaded from disk at runtime by
`ThemeManager` (deliberately excluded from BAML compilation in the csproj).

Layers: `Views/` (XAML) ↔ `View Models/` (`VM_*`) ↔ `BackEnd/` services ↔
`Models/` (plain serializable state).

### Central state model
`Models/Settings.cs` is the persisted root (serialized to `Settings.json` next to
the exe). Key pieces:
- **`ModSettings: List<ModSetting>`** — each `ModSetting` represents one selectable
  "mod": a `DisplayName`, the plugins it owns (`CorrespondingModKeys`), where its
  files live (`CorrespondingFolderPaths`), its mugshot folders, and the NPCs it
  provides (`NpcFormKeys*`). This is the spine of the whole app.
- **`SelectedAppearanceMods`** — per-NPC FormKey → the chosen mod + source NPC.
- Two **reserved synthetic auto-generated entries** exist by name: **"Base Game"**
  (vanilla masters: Skyrim/Update/Dawnguard/HearthFires/Dragonborn) and
  **"Creation Club"** (cc* plugins). They are (re)created in
  `VM_Mods.AddBaseAndCreationClubMods`. Several subsystems look these up *by their
  display name* — notably the mugshot BSA adapter (which registers vanilla BSAs
  off the "Base Game" entry) and the NPC menu. If the "Base Game" entry is
  missing or non-auto-generated, vanilla assets fail to resolve and vanilla NPCs
  drop out of the menu, so its existence is guarded/self-healed during population.

### Mod-list population & analysis (`VM_Mods`)
`PopulateModSettingsAsync` is the load pipeline: FaceGen path caching → load mods
from `Settings.ModSettings` → scan mugshot-only folders → scan mod folders →
consolidate → `AddBaseAndCreationClubMods` → `AnalyzeModSettingsAsync`. Analysis
runs `VM_ModSetting.RefreshNpcLists` per mod (loading the mod's plugins to map
which NPCs it provides; gated on `HasModPathsAssigned || IsAutoGenerated`). An
analysis cache (`LastKnownState` snapshot, `Models/StateSnapshot.cs`) skips
re-analysis on a cache hit — null the snapshot to force re-analysis.
Note the two-list pattern: **`_allModSettingsInternal`** is the full in-memory VM
list; **`_settings.ModSettings`** is the persisted subset. `SaveModSettingsToModel`
syncs in-memory → model (dropping entries with no keys/folders), and is guarded so
an Invalid environment can't overwrite good persisted settings.

### Environment
`BackEnd/EnvironmentStateProvider.cs` wraps Mutagen's `GameEnvironment`
(load order, link cache, data folder). `SetEnvironmentTarget` +
`UpdateEnvironment` (re)resolve it from `SkyrimRelease` + game path;
`BaseGamePlugins`/`CreationClubPlugins` derive from the version via Mutagen
`Implicits`. Changing the release/path re-resolves the environment but must **not**
delete the user's mod settings (only a mods-folder change does that).

### Patching (`BackEnd/Patcher.cs`)
`RunPatchingLogic` is the entry point. Three behaviors driven by `PatchingMode` /
`UseSkyPatcherMode`: *Create* (splice selected appearances into a standalone
plugin), *Create and Patch* (delta into the conflict-winning load order, like
EasyNPC), and *SkyPatcher* (emit a SkyPatcher .ini instead of editing NPC
records). Supporting services: `RecordHandler`/`RecordDeltaPatcher` (record copy
and non-NPC override delta patching), `AssetHandler` (textures/meshes),
`PluginProvider` (ref-counted cache of loaded plugin getters; resolves a ModKey
to a path via the mod's folders, then falls back to the game Data folder),
`BsaHandler`/`PluginArchiveIndex` (BSA reading), `Validator` (pre-patch screening
of masters/races), `SkyPatcherInterface`, `EasyNpcTranslator` (profile import/export).

**Override-discovery roots (`BackEnd/NpcRootFieldCatalog.cs`).** Under Include /
Include As New the patcher searches for records the appearance mod overrides by
walking outward from the NPC record. It roots that walk only at the NPC *fields*
the user has ticked in the per-mod **Override Roots** dialog — defaulting to the
appearance set (RNAM/WNAM/FTST/HCLF/PNAM/DOFT/SOFT/TPLT). **Roots, not record
types:** a ticked field is followed to unlimited depth through any record type.
It used to root at every link on the record, so AI packages were roots — and from
a package the walk reaches placed references, cells, quests and other NPCs, whose
whole ancestry then got copied in as private duplicates (a measured run repointed
six NPCs' package links at copies of vanilla packages referencing copies of `DB01`
and `SolitudeOpening`). The catalog is the single source of truth for both the
dialog and the walk; `NpcRootFieldCatalogTests` asserts by reflection that every
FormLink-bearing field of `INpcGetter` has an entry, so a missing field fails CI
rather than silently becoming unreachable. Precedence: per-mod
`ModSetting.OverrideTraversalRoots` ?? `Settings.DefaultOverrideTraversalRoots` ??
catalog defaults — null at both levels (including settings files predating the
option) resolves to the appearance set, which is how existing installs pick up the
narrowed roots with no migration.

**Orphan sweep (`Patcher.PruneAndLogOrphanedDuplicates`).** Just before the save, any output
record nothing references — no FormLink in the plugin, no SkyPatcher directive, no generated
SPID assignment — is dead cargo. Records **duplicated from a source** are removed (repeating to
a fixpoint, since dropping a copy orphans the sub-records only it referenced); records this run
**authored** and NPC records are only reported, in case a future channel delivers one by FormID.
The population is mostly wig handling: it strips a converted ArmorAddon out of the WornArmor
duplicate, but the appearance merge still walks the ORIGINAL WornArmor — the seeded duplicate
mapping stops the armor itself from being copied, not the traversal of its links — so every
superseded child is copied and then pointed at by nothing (measured: 135, of which 129
`HighPoly_WigAA_*`). **Do not "fix" this by suppressing the walk instead**: that was tried and
is unsafe, because the same record can still be reachable from another copy the run makes, and
skipping it leaves that copy pointing into a donor plugin that may not be in the load order —
Mutagen then refuses to write the plugin at all (`Route5_AntlerRemove_AllThreeSources` reproduces
it). Judging the finished output cannot make that mistake. Pinned end-to-end by Routes 4 and 5 in
`WigRouteTwoModeTests`.

### Mugshot generation (`BackEnd/CharacterViewerHost/`)
`InternalMugshotGenerator` / `BatchMugshotGenerator` drive the `IOffscreenRenderer`
from `CharacterViewer.Rendering`. NPC2's services are bound behind the renderer's
interfaces by the **`Adapters/`** (e.g. `NpcChooserBsaProviderAdapter` →
`IBsaArchiveProvider`, `NpcChooserNpcMeshDataSourceAdapter` → `INpcMeshDataSource`,
`NpcChooserDataFolderAdapter`, logger/settings adapters) so the renderer never
sees Mutagen or NPC2 types directly. The renderer is a singleton (its GLFW window
+ FBO are amortized; the factory must run on the WPF UI thread).
`PortraitCreator` is a separate path that shells out to the external
`NPCPortraitCreator.exe`.

## Diagnostics (use these first)
The app emits several opt-in logs next to the exe — prefer reading them over
speculating from code. The human-readable diagnostics are **self-contained HTML
files** (shared infrastructure in `BackEnd/Logging/`: `HtmlLog` markup/theme,
streaming `HtmlLogWriter`, buffered `HtmlLogDocument`); rows stream out with
immediate flush, so a crashed/hung session still leaves a renderable file:
- **`StartupLog.html`** (`StartupLogger`) — phased startup trace incl. environment
  resolution and the full mod-population pipeline. Enable via the `LogStartup`
  setting or a file trigger.
- **`BsaContentsDiag.html`** (`BsaContentsDiag`) — BSA registration + per-asset
  hit/miss for mugshot resolution. Opt-in: drop a `LogBsaDiag.txt` file next to
  the exe. Recreated per session on first logged event (the txt era appended
  across sessions).
- **`AssetProvenance.csv`** (`AssetProvenanceDiag`) — per patch run, why each asset
  file was copied into the output. One CSV row per atomic reference (columns: `DestFile,
  Reason, Referencer, NPC, TargetFormKey, Mod, DonorFormKey, DonorEditorID, SourceKind,
  SourcePath`) — sort/pivot in a spreadsheet to view by-file or by-NPC. `Reason` is
  FaceGen / PluginRef / NifTexture / SmpXml / AssetLink (plus IsolatedRef / IsolatedNifTexture
  for Include-As-New isolation copies, delivered under `meshes|textures\NPC2\<mod>\`); `Referencer` names the specific
  referencing record for PluginRef (e.g. `HeadPart 'Hair01' [ID]`) or the source NIF/XML
  for NifTexture/SmpXml. Unlike the other opt-in logs this is **user-facing**: the "Log
  Asset Provenance" checkbox in Settings > Logging (`Settings.LogAssetProvenance`),
  applied at runtime so it takes effect on the next Run. A `LogAssetProvenance.txt` file
  next to the exe still force-enables it as a dev fallback.
- **`RecordProvenance.csv`** (`RecordProvenanceDiag`) — per patch run, every non-NPC record
  merged into the output plugin and the reference chain that pulled it in. One CSV row per
  output record, first discovery wins (columns: `OutputFormKey, SourceFormKey, EditorID, Type,
  Kind, ProvenanceHistory`). `Type` is the record type's registration name (Armor, ArmorAddon,
  TextureSet, ...); `Kind` is MergedAsNew / BridgeParent / Override / DeltaPatchedOverride /
  BulkOverrideImport / Generated — **MergedAsNew is a record the selected mod itself carries,
  BridgeParent is one it does not**, copied only to keep an overridden descendant reachable
  (the vanilla Outfit above RS Children's ArmorAddons), so that column is what tells you whether
  a surprising record was really edited by the mod or just walked through;
  `ProvenanceHistory` is a single cell of source-side
  `FormKey (EditorID) -> ... -> FormKey (EditorID)` from the root NPC down to the record
  (bulk 'Include All' imports get a placeholder — nothing was traversed). Patched NPC records
  themselves are excluded, but an NPC pulled in as a NEW record (e.g. via a Template chain) IS
  logged. Also **user-facing**: the "Log Record Provenance" checkbox in Settings > Logging
  (`Settings.LogRecordProvenance`), applied at runtime; a `LogRecordProvenance.txt` file next
  to the exe force-enables it as a dev fallback. Chain capture lives in the merge walkers
  (`PatcherExtensions.DuplicateFromOnlyReferencedGetters`, `RecordHandler`'s override
  traversals); the Patcher sets the per-NPC root context and flushes alongside
  `AssetProvenanceDiag` — after the orphan sweep below, so the CSV describes the plugin that
  was actually written.
- **`RenderLogs/`** — per-NPC mugshot render traces (asset resolution paths).
- **`Rejected NPCs/`** — logs why each discarded NPC was excluded from the menu.

## Release Workflow

- **The version-bump commit must always be the LAST commit before a release
  upload.** Do not author further commits on top of a version bump intended for
  release — that release would silently include the later changes under the
  bumped version. The version is defined centrally in `App.ProgramVersion`
  (App.xaml.cs) and mirrored into `Settings.ProgramVersion`.
- If commits are needed after a version bump, treat the bump as stale and make a
  fresh version-bump commit so it is again the final pre-release commit.
- When committing on top of an existing version-bump commit, flag it to the user
  so they can decide whether to re-bump before uploading.
