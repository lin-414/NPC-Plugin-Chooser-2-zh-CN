/// the NPC really wears — resolved through the SkyPatcher/SPID simulation, so the
/// duplicate already has the runtime-distributed content — adds the wig/antler, and
/// points the patched NPC record at it. A record-level <c>DefaultOutfit</c> is the
/// bottom of the runtime stack though: SkyPatcher rewrites <c>defaultOutfit</c> at
/// <c>kDataLoaded</c> and SPID distributes on actor load, so both overwrite the
/// assignment and the wig disappears. The only way to keep it is to speak the same
/// language, which is what this class emits.</para>

/// its config walk, and NPC2's subfolder is read after every root-level config, so the
/// directive wins unless a competing config sits in a subfolder sorting after "NPC
/// Plugin Chooser" — the one case the resolver reports as

/// about.</item>
/// <item><b>SPID</b> — an <c>Outfit =</c> line in a generated <c>*_DISTR.ini</c> at the
/// output's Data root. SPID distributes outfits with <c>for_first_form</c>: the FIRST

/// is deliberately prefixed with '!' to sort ahead of ordinary configs. When a
/// contesting config still sorts earlier, that is reported rather than silently lost.
