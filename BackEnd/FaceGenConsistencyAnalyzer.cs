/// Detects mismatches between a baked FaceGen geometry NIF and the head parts an
/// NPC actually references in a given resolution context. The Creation Kit bakes

///
/// <para>This analyzer reproduces the reconciliation as a static check and reports

/// loaded at the wrong version, a missing master, a null head part link, or a
/// mod author shipping a .nif that simply doesn't match its plugin). The shape of the
