# Description

This utility allows you to manage which mod provides the appearance of each NPC in the game. You can use it to easily mix-and-match appearance mods, avoiding face conflicts / dark face bugs.


## Why Does This Exist?

Let’s get this out of the way: Yes, I know [EasyNPC](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/52313) exists. A bit of backstory: Back in 2021 I created the original [NPC Plugin Chooser](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/49066), which was a Synthesis patcher or standalone command line program. N.P.C. was, for a time, included in [Lexy’s LotD](https://lexyslotd.com/), which I’m still very proud of.  Then, just a few months later, EasyNPC came out and its UI blew N.P.C. out of the water, so I let the project phase out into peaceful eternity… or so I thought.

In early 2025, I was reminiscing about the early days so I went back to look at the N.P.C. Nexus page and found something horrifying in the comments: My instructions had given someone an aneurysm. Even worse, another user chimed in and said they had one as well! I’ve always wanted to be helpful to the community and yet here I was, apparently laying ticking time bombs for unsuspecting users to stumble onto. I felt like I needed to make it right. There had always been a few features that I wished EasyNPC had (see below), but I always figured it’d be too much work to make a whole app just for those features. Fortuitously, right at that moment, someone on Discord was trying to convince me that LLMs could already make entire apps from scratch, so I figured this would be a perfect opportunity to test that claim (more on this below as well). And so N.P.C.2 was born. 


## Do I Need This?

If you’re already using EasyNPC and you’re happy with it, there’s not really any reason to switch. EasyNPC’s developer is much more experienced and meticulous than I am and you’re probably less likely to run into issues with it. But if you’re still looking to put together your NPC list, you might want to take advantage of some of the features here. Note that if you enjoy my UI but want to take advantage of EasyNPC’s well-tested code, N.P.C.2 has buttons to export to (and import from) EasyNPC.


## What Are The Features?

* Lets you select the source of each NPC’s appearance (just like EasyNPC and N.P.C.1)
* Lets you use a different NPC's appearance (just like my NPC Appearance Copier Synthesis Patcher), and even build a library of your favorite faces to reuse
* More flexible mod selection UI
    * Gallery view for NPC mugshots
    * You’re allowed to select mods even if you don’t currently have them installed - you can make your selections based on mugshots, and then download only those mods that you ended up choosing. 
    * Short (hopefully spoiler-free) description (base game NPCs only) to help you choose an appearance if you don’t know who they are. [Optional]
    * Quick full screen mugshot preview, plus an interactive 3D preview you can rotate and relight
    * Quick comparison button to compare a subset of available mugshots side-by-side
    * Drag-and-drop functionality to apply mugshots to a mod if their names don’t match
    * Drag-and-drop functionality to replace ModA with ModB wherever an NPC can choose from both
    * “Choose this mod for all NPCs it provides” button
    * Mod menu where you can see the mugshots of all NPCs within the mod
    * A Summary tab that shows all of your choices at a glance
* Generate your own mugshots
    * If a mod doesn’t ship mugshots, N.P.C.2 can render them for you using its built-in 3D renderer, or fetch them from the online FaceFinder service.
* Non-appearance override handling
    * If an NPC mod overrides records that aren’t typically associated with Appearance Replacers, such as Races, N.P.C.2 can handle that. 
* Wig and antler handling
    * Some appearance mods deliver hair as a *wig* — an armor worn in the hair slot, or a hair mesh carried in the NPC’s skin — rather than as a normal head part, which usually means the hair vanishes the moment the NPC’s outfit changes. N.P.C.2 detects wigs and can move them into the NPC’s skin so they always show, add them to the outfit the NPC actually wears, or (experimentally) bake them into the FaceGen so they become real hair. Antlers are controlled separately, and can be **removed** outright.
* Not-In-Load-Order Mod Sources
    * I personally hate, hate, hate enabling and disabling plugins in my mod manager just for patching. So, NPC doesn’t require mods to be active in your load order. In fact, they don’t even have to be enabled at all. In fact, they don’t even have to be in the same mod manager installation. You can launch N.P.C.2 from C:\LoreRim, and tell it your mods folder is in C:\MO2InstallationForAppearanceMods\mods, and use those appearance mods to patch your LoreRim install.
* Create Mode
    * N.P.C.2 offers two modes: “Create”, or “Create And Patch”. “Create And Patch” is like EasyNPC: it patches your load order to your selected appearance mods. “Create” is how I used to like doing things: it ignores your load order and just splices together the mods you suggested exactly as they are. The idea is you treat the generated output just like you would any other appearance mod: put it up high in your plugin load order, low in your asset order, and then use something like Synthesis FaceFixer to forward the NPC appearances into your mod list. 
* SkyPatcher Mode
    * SkyPatcher is all the rage these days. I personally don’t think it’s a great idea to use for appearance mods because then you have to make exclusions for things like RSV or SynthEBD, but I know people would ask for it so I went ahead and included it. With SkyPatcher mode, N.P.C.2 applies its selections using SkyPatcher instead of modifying the NPC records (duh).
* Output Verification Tools
    * After you build your output you can run the Validator to confirm that the deployed result actually matches your selections, and Analyze Masters to see exactly why your output plugin depends on each of its masters.
* Group Splitting
    * You can assign NPCs to groups and only generate output for those groups. This can be useful if you get Too Many Masters errors and don’t want to switch to SkyPatcher mode. N.P.C.2 can also automatically split the output into multiple plugins by gender, race, or a maximum NPC count.
* Bat File Generation
    * You can quickly generate bat files to spawn all NPCs in your selected Group. This can be useful if you want to check and make sure they all look ok. 


# Installation

N.P.C.2 is theoretically compatible with both MO2 and Vortex, but I’ve only ever tested with MO2.

Install like you would any other similar utility such as EasyNPC. Extract the contents of the zip file to the location of your choice. Add the .exe as an executable in your mod manager, and run it from your mod manager.


## Basic Usage

> **First launch:** A splash screen appears while N.P.C.2 starts up. The **first** time you select a mods folder, N.P.C.2 analyzes every mod and builds a cache — this can take a while, so be patient. Every launch after that reuses the cache and is much faster.

1. Launch the .exe (through your mod manager).
2. In the **Settings** tab, set the Skyrim version that you’re patching from the dropdown.
3. If you’re using a non-standard data directory (e.g. RootBuilder or Stock Game), set its data folder as the Game Data Path.
4. Select your **Mods Folder** and wait for analysis to complete (this takes longer the first time you select the mods folder than in subsequent launches).
    * If MO2, this will be your mo2\mods folder.
    * If Vortex, this will be your staging folder.
    * The mods folder can be, but does not have to be, the same one that’s used by the mod manager you’re using to launch the .exe. It should be the one to which your appearance mods are installed. This can be a completely separate MO2 or Vortex directory if you so choose.
5. Select your **Mugshots Folder** and wait for the mugshots to be linked to your mods. (If you don’t have mugshots for some mods, N.P.C.2 can generate them — see [Mugshot Settings](#mugshot-settings).)
6. Select your **Output Directory**.
    * If you just type in a name, you’ll get that folder created as a subfolder within the mods folder from step 4.
    * If you want to specify a folder in a different mod manager, type in the full path (or browse & select it).
7. Switch to the **NPCs** tab and make your selections.
    * To select from an existing option, just click the Mugshot or Placeholder for your desired appearance mod. The border will turn green if the selection is valid.
    * To apply the appearance from a different NPC, right-click the mugshot you want and use **Share with NPC** (see [Sharing an Appearance Between NPCs](#sharing-an-appearance-between-npcs)).
8. Switch to the **Run** tab & run the patcher.
9. Enable the resulting plugin and assets in your mod manager. Make sure the assets overwrite all conflicts.

> **Recommended setup:** you can leave your appearance-overhaul mods **disabled** in your mod manager. N.P.C.2 reads the data and assets it needs straight out of disabled mods, and keeping them disabled stops their records from sneaking into your output as master dependencies. (See [Analyze Masters](#analyze-masters) for an example of what happens when an overhaul is left active.)


# Detailed Usage

The app is organized into five tabs along the top: **NPCs**, **Mods**, **Summary**, **Settings**, and **Run**. The first time you launch, you’ll land on the Settings tab, which is where you tell N.P.C.2 about your setup.


## Settings Menu

This is where you point N.P.C.2 at your game and your mods, and configure how it generates output and displays mugshots.

Every section on this page is collapsible — click a section's header to fold it away, and the page shrinks to a list of headers you can scan. Game Environment, Mod Environment and Output Settings start open and the rest start closed, which is roughly the order you need them in when setting up. N.P.C.2 remembers which ones you left open.


### Game Environment

![Game Environment](docs/Screenshots/Settings/Game_Environment_Section.png)

These settings tell the program how your Skyrim installation is set up.

* **Skyrim Game Data Path**: Leave this blank for a standard Steam install — N.P.C.2 will auto-detect it. If your game is in a non-standard location (Stock Game, Root Builder, etc.), point the **Browse...** button at your `Data` folder.
* **Skyrim Version**: Pick the edition you’re patching (e.g. SkyrimSE, SkyrimVR). Make sure this matches the game version you’re modding.
* **Environment Status**: A live readout confirming that N.P.C.2 found a valid environment — the number of plugins in your load order, your data folder, your `plugins.txt`, and how many Creation Club plugins were detected. If something is wrong here, fix it before doing anything else.

#### “Valid (no mod plugins found)”

![No mod plugins warning](docs/Screenshots/Settings/Environment_Status_No_Mod_Plugins_Warning.png)

If the status turns amber and reads **Valid (no mod plugins found)**, N.P.C.2 resolved a perfectly working environment that happens to contain nothing but base-game and Creation Club plugins. That almost always means one thing: **N.P.C.2 wasn’t launched through your mod manager.**

N.P.C.2 reads your load order from Windows’ own `Plugins.txt`. MO2 and Vortex redirect that file to the active profile’s load order — but only for programs launched *through* them. Launch the .exe directly and you get the Skyrim launcher’s own list instead, which is usually just the vanilla masters.

The confusing part is that nothing looks broken: your appearance mods still show up, because those are read straight out of the Mods folder. What quietly breaks is everything downstream of the load order — the patcher won’t be patching against the right conflict winners, and the NPCs menu will only ever show you base-game and Creation Club NPCs.

The fix is to relaunch N.P.C.2 from your mod manager, and to check that the **Skyrim Game Data Path** above matches the one your mod manager is set to.


### Mod Environment

![Mod Environment](docs/Screenshots/Settings/Mod_Environment_Section.png)

Here you tell N.P.C.2 where to find your appearance mods.

* **Mods Folder**: The root folder where your mods are installed (for MO2 this is the `mods` folder; for Vortex it’s your staging folder). This **does not** have to be the same folder used by the mod manager you launched N.P.C.2 from — you can point it at a completely separate mod directory if you want to keep your appearance mods elsewhere.
* **Filter by active mods (MO2)**: If checked, only mods that are enabled in MO2 are considered. Leave it unchecked if you want to see appearance mods even when they’re disabled.


### Output Settings

![Output Settings](docs/Screenshots/Settings/Output_Settings_Section.png)

Here you control the files that N.P.C.2 generates.

* **Output Directory**: Where the generated plugin and assets go. A simple name (e.g. `NPC Output`) creates that folder inside your Mods Folder; a full path sends output wherever you specify (use this if your Mods Folder isn’t your mod manager’s folder).
* **Append Date/Time Stamp to Output Directory**: Adds a timestamp to the output folder name so you never overwrite a previous run.
* **Output Plugin Name**: The name of the generated plugin (e.g. `NPC` → `NPC.esp`).
* **Patching Mode**: The core behavior of the patcher (click the **?** for in-app help):
    * *Create and Patch*: Behaves like EasyNPC. Your conflict-winning NPC records are patched to use your selected appearance mods. No further action required.
    * *Create*: Splices your selections into a standalone appearance mod without considering your load order — treat it like any other appearance mod you’d download (put its plugin high in the load order, its assets low, and resolve conflicts yourself or with Synthesis FaceFixer).
* **Override Handling Mode**: How the patcher treats appearance mods that *modify* preexisting **non-NPC** records. To be clear about what this means: most appearance mods ship their own brand-new (“de novo”) support records — skins, head parts, tints, and the like — and those are always carried over normally. What’s rare, and what this setting actually controls, is when a mod **overrides** a record that *already exists* (a base-game Race, Outfit, etc.) rather than adding its own. This is a default that can be overridden per-mod in the Mods tab. Options are *Ignore*, *Include*, and *Include As New* (explained under [Mods Menu](#record-override-handling) and in the FAQ). **Leave this on *Ignore* here** — override handling is slow and 99% of mods don’t need it; turn it on only for the specific mods that do.
* **SkyPatcher Mode**: If checked, N.P.C.2 writes a SkyPatcher `.ini` instead of editing NPC records directly. Handy if you prefer SkyPatcher, but be aware it can conflict with other runtime appearance patchers like RSV or SynthEBD.
* **Templated NPCs**: Some NPCs (many bandits, guards, and other generic actors) don't have a face of their own — they copy it from another NPC via Skyrim's template system, and the NPCs tab marks them with a Template badge. This setting applies in both normal and SkyPatcher mode, and is a default that can be overridden per-mod in the Mods tab (the dropdown appears there for mods that contain templated NPCs):
    * *Use the template's appearance* (default) — templated NPCs keep showing the other NPC's face in game, and any appearance you pick for them is ignored (their mugshot still shows your pick, but the game won't).
    * *Give each NPC its own copy* — your choice is applied to each templated NPC individually, so NPCs that share a template can look different from each other. Costs one extra copy of the face files per templated NPC. NPCs whose face the game picks at random from a levelled list have no fixed face to copy and keep inheriting either way.
* **Auto-ESLify If Possible**: Flags the output plugin as ESL (light) when it qualifies, so it doesn’t consume a full load-order slot.
* **Auto-split if over the master limit**: If the output plugin would exceed Skyrim’s 255-master limit, it is automatically split into multiple files (`MyPatch.esp`, `MyPatch_2.esp`, …) instead of failing. A normal-sized patch stays a single plugin; when a split does happen, **all** of the resulting plugins must be enabled in your load order. Also applies per-plugin when Split Output (below) is on.
* **Split Output**: Splits your output into multiple plugins instead of one. You can split *by Gender*, *by Race*, and/or by a *Max # NPCs* per plugin. This is useful for dodging “Too Many Masters” errors without switching to SkyPatcher mode.

#### Head Editing (wigs & antlers)

![Head Editing settings](docs/Screenshots/Settings/Head_Editing_Section.png)

A **Head Editing** box sits at the bottom of Output Settings. It holds the *defaults* for how N.P.C.2 handles two things some appearance mods do to a head that plain appearance forwarding doesn’t cope with well: **wigs** and **antlers**. Both are detected automatically when N.P.C.2 analyzes your mods, and both can be overridden per mod in the [Mods tab](#wig-and-antler-handling-per-mod).

These settings apply in **Create and Patch** mode and in **SkyPatcher** mode. They are inert in plain **Create** mode, which forwards the appearance mod’s whole NPC record as-is.

**What’s a wig?** Instead of giving an NPC hair as a head part, some mods put the hair on an *armor* worn in the hair slot — either as an item in the NPC’s Default Outfit, or carried directly in the NPC’s skin (worn armor; the High Poly NPC Overhaul pattern). This works fine in the mod’s own context, but as soon as anything changes the NPC’s outfit, the hair goes with it and you get a bald NPC.

* **Default Wig Handling Mode**:
    * *Forward To Skin* — an outfit wig is moved into the NPC’s skin, so it shows no matter what outfit they end up wearing. (Falls back to *Forward To Outfit* if the appearance plugin assigns no worn armor.) A wig that’s already skin-carried is left alone.
    * *Forward To Outfit* — the outfit the NPC actually wears in game is duplicated and the wig added to the duplicate. A skin-carried wig is moved into that outfit as a generated wig armor. **Avoid this mode in SkyPatcher output mode** — N.P.C.2 warns you if you combine them. SkyPatcher assigns the outfit but never drives the engine's equip pass, so some affected NPCs spawn naked with the outfit sitting unequipped in their inventory, and nothing in the output distinguishes an NPC that will work from one that won't. *Forward To Skin* and *Convert To Headparts* ride on record fields SkyPatcher handles fine.
    * *Convert To Headparts* (**EXPERIMENTAL**) — the wig armor is thrown away and the wig becomes the NPC’s *hair*: N.P.C.2 generates head part records and bakes the wig mesh into the FaceGen file (HDT-SMP physics is preserved). The wig then survives outfit changes completely, and helmets hide it the way they hide normal hair. Selecting this pops a confirmation, because it rewrites the face mesh — verify the result by spawning the affected NPCs and checking for the dark face bug. If a bake would be unsafe for a particular NPC (e.g. the appearance mod ships no baked hair to replace), that NPC quietly falls back to *Forward To Skin*. The wig’s hair color is handled too — see **Converted Wig Hair Color** below.
    * *Leave As Is* (default) — wigs get no special treatment: an outfit wig is forwarded only if Include Outfits is on, and a skin-carried wig stays in the skin.

    **Choosing between them** comes down to what *else* in your load order touches your NPCs, because each delivery vehicle can be overwritten by a different kind of mod:

    | Mode | Outfit distributors (SPID, SkyPatcher) | Skin-swapping mods (e.g. Racial Skin Variance) |
    |---|---|---|
    | *Forward To Skin* | ✔ Unaffected | ✘ A mod that replaces the NPC's skin takes the wig with it |
    | *Forward To Outfit* | ✘ A distributed outfit replaces the one carrying the wig | ✔ Unaffected |
    | *Convert To Headparts* | ✔ Unaffected | ✔ Unaffected |
    | *Leave As Is* | Depends on how the mod author shipped each wig — you inherit whichever weakness above applies | |

    Notes on the table:
    * **SynthEBD is not a threat to *Forward To Skin*** — it changes skins but deliberately patches around wigs.
    * *Forward To Outfit*'s weakness is partly defended by **Publish forwarded outfits to SkyPatcher/SPID** (below), which fights back through the distributor's own config — but a config N.P.C.2 can't beat still wins, so *Forward To Skin* is the safer default in a SPID-heavy load order.
    * *Convert To Headparts* is robust to both, and would be the obvious pick if it weren't still a **beta feature**. One specific concern you may read elsewhere: that converting a wig to head parts disrupts HDT-SMP physics. In the author's testing (the FoxGlove Auri mod, a full SMP wig) physics survived the conversion intact — but treat that as one data point, not a guarantee, and spot-check your own results in game.
* **Converted Wig Hair Color**: Only applies to *Convert To Headparts*, and it exists because of a quirk worth understanding — see [Why converted wigs need a hair color](#why-converted-wigs-need-a-hair-color) below. **Auto (placeholder tints only)** is the default: recolor a converted wig with the NPC’s own hair color, but only when the wig was shipped with a placeholder tint; wigs whose textures the author already colored are left alone. **Always use NPC’s hair color** recolors every converted wig, exactly as RaceMenu would have done to the original worn wig. **Keep the wig’s own color** leaves the baked color untouched.
* **Preview worn wigs the way RaceMenu tints them** (on by default): Affects **mugshots and the 3D preview only — never the patch output**. It makes previews of *unconverted* worn wigs use the NPC’s hair color, matching what you actually see in game with RaceMenu installed. Without it, mods like High Poly NPC Overhaul render every NPC black-haired in the gallery, which makes them impossible to judge. Uncheck it if you don’t use RaceMenu — then the black hair shown here is the truth.
* **Manual Wig Designation Scope**: The 3D preview’s **Set Wig Meshes** button lets you mark a skin-carried hair mesh as a wig (or un-mark a false positive). This dropdown controls how far that decision reaches: **All NPCs (any mod)** (default), **Same mod only**, or **Specific NPC(s) only**. It only controls *scope* — a wig is still only converted when its mod’s Wig Handling Mode says so.
* **Default Antler Handling Mode**: Antlers (and similar head-mounted extras) can live in an outfit, in the worn armor, or as a FaceGen head part. Modes are *Forward To Skin*, *Forward To Outfit*, *Leave As Is* (default) — same meanings as above — plus:
    * *Remove* — keep the antlers off the NPC entirely. This reaches all three places they can hide: stripped from a forwarded outfit, from the worn armor, and from the FaceGen. (Antlers baked into an outfit your load order owns, which N.P.C.2 isn’t forwarding, can’t be reached.)
* **Manual Antler Block Scope**: Same three choices as the wig scope, for head parts you designate by hand with the 3D preview’s **Set Antler Head Parts** button. Removal still requires that mod’s Antler Handling Mode to be *Remove*.
* **Publish forwarded outfits to SkyPatcher/SPID** (on by default): Some NPCs don’t get their outfit from a plugin record at all — **SkyPatcher** or **SPID** hands it to them when the game loads. For those NPCs, *Forward To Outfit* alone isn’t enough: N.P.C.2 duplicates the outfit they really wear and adds the wig/antler to it, but the distributor then overwrites the assignment at runtime and the wig vanishes. With this on, N.P.C.2 also writes its own config for exactly those NPCs — a SkyPatcher entry (in its own ini under `SKSE\Plugins\SkyPatcher\npc\NPC Plugin Chooser\`) when a SkyPatcher config is the one competing, a generated `!NPC Plugin Chooser - <plugin>_DISTR.ini` at the output root when a SPID config is — pointing at the duplicate that carries the wig/antler. Each generated line is preceded by a comment naming the NPC and the config that previously supplied its outfit, so you can see what was overridden and why. Nothing is written for NPCs whose outfit no distributor touches. Turn it off and those NPCs are only warned about in the patch log; the forwarded wig/antler will most likely not show up in game.

##### Why converted wigs need a hair color

If you’ve ever installed High Poly NPC Overhaul without RaceMenu and wondered why every NPC came out black-haired, this is the explanation.

The base game never tints worn armor. RaceMenu does — its skee64 plugin automatically recolors worn hair-slot items that use the Hair Tint shader. Wig authors rely on that, so they bake a dark placeholder color into the mesh and let RaceMenu replace it at runtime. Install the mod without RaceMenu and you get the placeholder: black hair.

That placeholder is what the gallery shows you if nothing intervenes — and it applies to every NPC the mod covers, not just the odd one, which is what makes the mod so hard to judge from mugshots:

<table>
<tr>
<td align="center"><img width="400" alt="Wig previewed with its placeholder tint" src="docs/Screenshots/Settings/RaceMenu_Hair_Tint_Off.png"></td>
<td align="center"><img width="400" alt="Wig previewed with the NPC's hair color" src="docs/Screenshots/Settings/RaceMenu_Hair_Tint_On.png"></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center"><em><strong>Off</strong> — the wig's baked placeholder color.</em></td>
<td align="center"><em><strong>On</strong> — the NPC's own hair color, as RaceMenu would render it.</em></td>
</tr>
</table>

*Convert To Headparts* bakes the wig into the FaceGen file, which means it’s no longer a worn item — so RaceMenu stops recoloring it, and the placeholder becomes permanent with no way to fix it in game. **Converted Wig Hair Color** closes that gap by baking the NPC’s real hair color in during the conversion, which is exactly what the Creation Kit does when it exports FaceGen for ordinary hair.

The color is taken from the NPC’s own FaceGen file, not from their record, so a converted wig matches the rest of that NPC’s hair-colored geometry (brows, beard) by construction. Those two sources genuinely disagree when something later in your load order overrides the hair color after the appearance mod exported its FaceGen — trusting the record instead would give you an NPC whose new hair doesn’t match his own beard.


### Display Settings

![Display Settings](docs/Screenshots/Settings/Display_Settings_Section.png)

Cosmetic and convenience options for the app itself.

* **Theme** / **Tab Style**: Control the color theme and how the top tabs are styled.
* **NPC Selection Label**: Adds a colored indicator to **every** NPC in the list that has a saved appearance selection, so you can see your progress at a glance. The color encodes the selection’s status — **green** = the chosen mod’s data is available, **purple** = you only have a mugshot (mod not installed), **red** = the NPC isn’t in your load order. Choose how the indicator is drawn: **Bar** (a colored stripe), **Text Color** (tints the NPC’s name), or **None**.
* **Auto-advance after selection**: When checked, choosing an appearance automatically moves you to the next NPC — great for blasting through a long list.
* **Enable Localization**: Shows **NPC names** in a language you pick, instead of the default (usually English). This affects *only* the NPC names in the list — the app’s own interface (buttons, menus, labels) stays in English. See the note below for how it behaves.
* **Don’t show me popup warnings for actions with potential side effects**: Suppresses the confirmation popups for bulk/destructive actions if you find them annoying.
* **NPC List Display**: Choose which identifiers appear next to each NPC in the left-hand list — **Name**, **EditorID**, **FormKey**, **FormID**, and/or **Template Status** — along with where they’re shown and which **Separator** character divides them.

#### A note on NPC name localization

![NPC names localized to Russian](docs/Screenshots/Settings/Localization_RU_Example.png)

When localization is on, N.P.C.2 asks each NPC’s plugin for that NPC’s name *in your chosen language*. Skyrim stores names in two ways: as plain embedded text, or as **localized strings** kept in separate per-language files (the `.STRINGS` files that ship with translated games and mods). For each NPC, N.P.C.2 uses the translated name **if that plugin actually provides one in your language**; if it doesn’t, it falls back to the default (English) text.

That’s why you’ll usually see a **mix of languages** in the list, as in the Russian example above. Vanilla and properly-translated NPCs show up in your language (e.g. `Йар гро-Гатук`, `Ходдрейд`), while names from English-only appearance mods — or records that simply have no translation for that language — fall back to English (e.g. `Heratar`, `Woodcutter`). Entries shown by their EditorID rather than a real name (e.g. `DA05_LvlHuntersOfHircine_OrcM`, typically generic/unnamed leveled NPCs) are never translated, since an EditorID isn’t a localized string. In short: what you get depends on which translations actually exist in your installed plugins — N.P.C.2 just surfaces whatever is (or isn’t) there.


### Mugshot Settings

![Mugshot Settings](docs/Screenshots/Settings/Mugshot_Settings_Section.png)

“Mugshots” are the face preview images you click on in the NPCs tab. N.P.C.2 can draw them from up to three sources, and this section controls all of them.

* **Mugshots Folder**: The folder containing one subfolder of preview images per mod (the same layout EasyNPC uses).
* **Mugshot Source Priority**: A drag-to-reorder list of the three sources — **Downloaded Mugshots**, **FaceFinder**, and **Auto-Generation**. When more than one source has an image for the same mod/NPC, the one higher in this list wins. Disabled sources are skipped.
* **Use FaceFinder API for missing mugshots** / **Auto-Generate missing mugshots**: Enable the two generated sources (detailed below).
* **Normalize Image Dimensions**: Shows every mugshot at the same size and aspect ratio (cropping to center if needed). Uncheck it to show images at their raw resolution.
* **Max # Mugshots To Fit On Screen**: When you select an NPC, N.P.C.2 shrinks the mugshots until up to this many fit on screen. Higher = more on screen but smaller and slower to load. You can always zoom afterward.

#### FaceFinder (online mugshots)

![FaceFinder settings](docs/Screenshots/Settings/Mugshot_Settings_Section_FaceFinder.png)

If you check **Use FaceFinder API for missing mugshots**, N.P.C.2 can download face previews from the online FaceFinder service for mods you don’t have local mugshots for.

* **FaceFinder Cache Folder**: Where downloaded images are cached (one subfolder per mod). **Cache downloaded images locally** keeps them so they don’t have to be re-fetched.
* **Log API Requests/Responses**: Diagnostic logging for troubleshooting connection issues.
* **Link Mod Names to FaceFinder**: Opens the linking window (below) so you can match your locally-installed mods to FaceFinder’s database when the names don’t line up.
* **Batch Download Mugshots**: Pre-fetches FaceFinder mugshots for your whole mod list in one pass, so you’re not waiting on downloads later.
* **Delete All Cached FaceFinder Images**: Clears the FaceFinder cache.
* **Search Mode**: Sitting next to **Delete All Cached**, this dropdown only affects how that deletion takes stock of what’s on disk before clearing it — it has no effect on downloading. *Fast* trusts N.P.C.2’s cached list of downloaded images (recommended); *Comprehensive* re-scans every mugshot folder and reads each image’s metadata (slower, but catches files the cache doesn’t know about).

![FaceFinder link window](docs/Screenshots/Settings/Mugshot_Settings_Section_FaceFinder_LinkWindow.png)

In the **Link Local Mods to FaceFinder** window, drag a mod from the FaceFinder list on the left onto the matching local mod on the right to create a link. Mods that are already linked show a green sub-label with an **x** to unlink them. Both lists have search boxes to help you find a specific mod.

#### Auto-Generation (built-in 3D renderer)

![Auto-Generation settings](docs/Screenshots/Settings/Mugshot_Settings_Section_Autogen.png)

If you check **Auto-Generate missing mugshots**, N.P.C.2 will render its own mugshots using a built-in 3D renderer, directly from the mod’s mesh/texture data — so you can preview any appearance mod even if nobody has published mugshots for it.

This setting controls **rendering, not displaying**. Renders you already have on disk keep showing in the galleries after you switch it back off — nothing you paid render time for disappears because automatic generation is now idle. That also means you can leave this off permanently and render NPCs one at a time with **Generate Mugshot** in the [mugshot right-click menu](#mugshot-right-click-menu), which is the light-touch way to work if you only want renders for the handful of mods that ship none.

NPCs that inherit their looks through the **Traits** template flag are rendered too: they own no face of their own, so N.P.C.2 follows the template chain (through *that mod’s* records, so two mods can disagree about it) and draws the face the game will actually give them — while still showing their own outfit. You’ll see the same face on the tile as on the NPC it inherits from, which is the point. Chains N.P.C.2 can’t follow — one ending in a leveled NPC, a missing record, or a loop — have no fixed appearance to show, so those tiles keep the placeholder.

* **Renderer**: Which engine produces the renders — **Internal** or **Legacy** (more on this below).
* **Auto-Generated Mugshots Folder**: Where the output images are saved (one subfolder per mod). **Reset** restores the default folder.
* **Batch Generate Mugshots**: Render mugshots in bulk for **All** mods (or a subset). **Asset-Validated Only** skips NPCs whose required assets are missing.
* **Camera / framing controls** (Camera Mode, Frame Top/Bottom, Yaw, Pitch, Hair pad, “Include hair / brows / mouth in framing”): Aim and frame the shot.
* **Background** / **Output** size: The background color and the pixel dimensions of the generated images.
* **Asset Resolution**: Controls which copy of an asset wins when the same file exists in more than one place (e.g. a BSA vs. a loose file).
* **Attire**: Whether the rendered character wears their **default outfit** and/or **headgear**.
* **Texture/geometry cache**: How much RAM the renderer’s decoded-texture and parsed-mesh caches may use while generating mugshots. *% Free RAM* (default) grows the cache into a share of spare system memory — the **Free RAM %** field beside it sets that share (default 85); *Fixed RAM* caps the total at a budget you type in; *Disabled* turns caching off entirely (slower, minimal RAM). Takes effect within a few renders, no restart needed.
* **Re-render When**: Which staleness checks trigger an automatic re-render of an existing mugshot — when it was produced by a **Newer renderer version**, when the **Stale Conditions** it was generated with (lighting, camera / framing, background, resolution, render options) no longer match your current settings, when it recorded **Missing NPC Assets** (the NPC’s own head/body/hair meshes or textures), or when it recorded **Missing Outfit Assets** (outfit/headgear meshes or textures — broken physics links are excluded, since installing something can’t fix a stale link inside the mod). The last two exist so that installing the missing files later fills in the wireframe/placeholder areas automatically. All four are on by default; turn one off to keep those mugshots in place instead of regenerating them.
* **Warning Icons**: **Show Missing NPC Assets Icon** and **Show Missing Outfit Assets Icon** (both on by default) each control one of the warning icons on mugshot tiles — and whether that state is recorded in the PNG at all. Unchecking one hides the icon and re-renders exactly the affected mugshots once so their recorded state is cleared. Note that while the NPC-assets icon is off, new renders record no missing assets, so *Re-render When: Missing NPC Assets* has nothing to act on for them.
* **Delete All Auto-Generated Mugshots**: Clears everything the renderer has produced. The adjacent **Search Mode** dropdown only changes how this deletion inventories existing renders first — *Fast* uses N.P.C.2’s cached list (recommended), *Comprehensive* re-scans all folders and reads metadata.

![Auto-Generation preview](docs/Screenshots/Settings/Mugshot_Settings_Section_Autogen_ShowPreview.png)

Click **Show Preview** to open a live preview of the renderer using the NPC you currently have selected. The yellow dashed rectangle shows the crop that will be applied to the final mugshot. Tune the controls until it looks right, then batch-generate.

**Load Selected NPC** loads whichever NPC is currently selected over in the **NPCs** tab into the preview, using the appearance mod you’ve chosen for that NPC. (So pick an NPC and give it an appearance there first, then come here to preview and tune it.)

The remaining controls along the top adjust how the render *looks*. None of them touch the underlying mod — they only shape the generated image:

* **Light Layout** — a preset arrangement of the scene’s lights (where each one sits and how bright it is). Pick a built-in preset, or save your own with **Save…**.
* **Color Scheme** — the color/warmth of the lights (e.g. warm vs. cool). Mixes freely with any layout.
* **Ambient** — the level of soft, even light filling the whole scene. Raise it to brighten the shadows, lower it for a moodier look.
* **FOV** — the camera “lens.” Lower values flatten the face for a flattering portrait look; higher values widen it toward a more in-game feel.
* **Key / Fill / Rim** — toggles for the three main lights: the **Key** (the primary light), the **Fill** (softens the shadows the key leaves behind), and the **Rim** (a back/edge light that separates the head from the background).
* **Show Lights** — draws a 3D arrow in the viewport for each light. **Click an arrow to open that light’s own editor**, where you can aim it and set its brightness and color (hue) individually.
* **Tone-mapping** — film-style color finishing that makes the result read like a photograph instead of a flat render. Several of the controls below only take effect when this is on.
* **Shadows** — lets facial features cast soft shadows (brow over the eyes, nose onto the cheek, hair onto the forehead).
* **SSAO** — subtle darkening in nooks and creases (eye sockets, nostrils, the lip line) that adds a sense of depth.
* **Eye catch-light** — adds the small bright glint in the eyes that makes them look alive.
* **SSS** — how much light appears to pass *through* and glow within the skin. Higher gives a warmer, fleshier, more lifelike look; 0 turns it off.
* **Skin Sat** — color intensity (saturation) of the skin only.
* **Vignette R / I** — a gentle darkening toward the edges of the frame. **R** sets how large the clear center stays; **I** sets how dark the corners get.
* **Exposure** — overall image brightness (1.0 is neutral).
* **Hair relief** — keeps hair from being crushed too dark by the tone-mapping, so brown/blonde hair holds onto its midtones.
* **Daylight** — brightens and slightly warms the lights toward a sunny, outdoor look (helps blonde hair match its in-game daylight appearance). The number beside it sets how strong the boost is.
* **Bloom** — a soft glow that bright highlights (like blonde hair) bleed into. The number beside it sets how strong the glow is.
* **Wireframe missing-tex** — when a shape’s texture fails to load, draws it as a green wireframe so the problem is obvious rather than silently hidden.
* **Shader Troubleshooting** — an experimental area for testing the renderer’s shader code. The defaults are fine for everyone; you can safely leave this alone.

#### Internal vs. Legacy renderer

The **Renderer** dropdown chooses which engine generates the mugshots. **Internal** is the modern, in-process renderer (with all the live preview and lighting controls described above) and is what you should use. **Legacy** is the older NPC Portrait Creator renderer, kept only for users who are attached to its particular visual style — it is **no longer being developed**. It lives in its own repository ([NPC-Portrait-Creator](https://github.com/Piranha91/NPC-Portrait-Creator)), and N.P.C.2 ships with a compiled copy bundled in.

![Legacy vs Internal renderer comparison](docs/Screenshots/Settings/Internal_Vs_Legacy_Renderer_Comparison.png)

*Legacy renderer (left) vs. Internal renderer (right) for the same mod.*

#### Which outfit does the preview wear?

When the **Attire** toggle has the character wearing their default outfit, N.P.C.2 doesn't just show the outfit from the appearance mod's plugin — it predicts the outfit the NPC will *actually wear in game* after your patching-mode choice **and** any runtime outfit distributors (SkyPatcher configs, SPID `_DISTR.ini` files) have had their say. Mugshots and the [3D preview](#3d-preview) both follow these rules, and a mugshot only re-renders when the *resolved outfit itself* changes — flipping settings that land on the same outfit costs nothing.

Legend for the tables below:

* **Mod's outfit** — the outfit from the selected appearance mod's plugin (what **Include Outfit** would carry into the output).
* **Winning outfit** — the outfit on the conflict-winning override of the NPC in your load order (what EasyNPC-style patching preserves).
* **SkyPatcher outfit** — the outfit set by the *last* matching `outfitDefault=` line across your installed SkyPatcher npc configs (that's the one SkyPatcher itself applies).
* **SPID outfit** — the outfit from the *first* matching `Outfit =` entry across your `*_DISTR.ini` files (that's the one SPID itself applies). Entries with a chance below 100 are random at runtime and are never depicted.

An external entry only "matches" if its filters match the NPC **and** its outfit actually resolves in your load order; otherwise it's skipped and the next row down supplies the outfit.

**Normal mode (SkyPatcher Mode off):**

| Patching mode | Include Outfit | SkyPatcher ini matches | SPID entry matches | Preview displays | Warning shown |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Create | ✘ | ✘ | ✘ | Mod's outfit | — |
| Create | ✘ | ✘ | ✔ | SPID outfit | — |
| Create | ✘ | ✔ | any | SkyPatcher outfit | — |
| Create | ✔ | ✘ | ✘ | Mod's outfit | — |
| Create | ✔ | ✘ | ✔ | SPID outfit | ⚠ Include Outfit overridden by SPID |
| Create | ✔ | ✔ | any | SkyPatcher outfit | ⚠ Include Outfit overridden by SkyPatcher |
| Create and Patch | ✘ | ✘ | ✘ | Winning outfit | — |
| Create and Patch | ✘ | ✘ | ✔ | SPID outfit | — |
| Create and Patch | ✘ | ✔ | any | SkyPatcher outfit | — |
| Create and Patch | ✔ | ✘ | ✘ | Mod's outfit | — |
| Create and Patch | ✔ | ✘ | ✔ | SPID outfit | ⚠ Include Outfit overridden by SPID |
| Create and Patch | ✔ | ✔ | any | SkyPatcher outfit | ⚠ Include Outfit overridden by SkyPatcher |

Note the Create-mode quirk: Create forwards the appearance mod's whole NPC record, so the mod's outfit ships even with **Include Outfit** off — the checkbox only changes whether a runtime override *warns* you.

**SkyPatcher Mode (either patching mode — neither touches the NPC record at plugin level):**

With **Include Outfit** on, N.P.C.2's own SkyPatcher ini sets the outfit, so it competes with any external SkyPatcher configs by ordinary SkyPatcher config order — whichever loads later wins. (Configs directly in `SkyPatcher\npc\` load before any subfolder; subfolders load in name order, so only a subfolder sorting after `NPC Plugin Chooser` beats N.P.C.2's entry.)

| Include Outfit | SkyPatcher ini matches | SPID entry matches | Preview displays | Warning shown |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ✘ | ✘ | ✘ | Winning outfit | — |
| ✘ | ✘ | ✔ | SPID outfit | — |
| ✘ | ✔ | any | SkyPatcher outfit | — |
| ✔ | ✘ | ✘ | Mod's outfit (via N.P.C.2's ini) | — |
| ✔ | ✘ | ✔ | Mod's outfit — N.P.C.2's directive suspends SPID | — |
| ✔ | ✔, loads *before* N.P.C.2's ini | any | Mod's outfit | — |
| ✔ | ✔, loads *after* N.P.C.2's ini | any | SkyPatcher outfit | ⚠ N.P.C.2's SkyPatcher entry not conflict-winning |

**Why SkyPatcher beats SPID:** SPID deliberately backs off an NPC whose default outfit no longer matches the value it read from the plugins — and SkyPatcher's edits (including N.P.C.2's own, in SkyPatcher Mode) are exactly such a change. Two edge cases bend the tables:

* If SkyPatcher assigns the **same** outfit the record already has (including N.P.C.2's directive being a no-op because the mod's outfit equals the winning one), SPID does *not* suspend — a matching SPID entry wins after all, and with **Include Outfit** on you'll get the SPID-overridden warning.
* A runtime winner that happens to equal the mod's outfit displays without a warning — what you asked for is what's shown.

When a warning applies, the mugshot tile shows an orange **⚠** badge (hover it for which config wins and why) and the 3D preview shows a banner; when a distributor changes the outfit *without* defeating an Include Outfit request, the preview's status line simply notes where the outfit came from. Rare filter types that only exist at runtime (skill-based filters, sub-100% chances) are treated conservatively and called out as approximations in the tooltip.

### FaceGen Analysis

![FaceGen Analysis settings](docs/Screenshots/Settings/FaceGen_Analysis_Section.png)

An optional diagnostic that reports how *heavy* each appearance’s FaceGen mesh is, so you can spot mods whose head/hair geometry is absurdly high-poly — a common cause of performance problems. It’s off by default.

* **Enable FaceGen Analysis** — turns it on. N.P.C.2 then inspects each mugshot’s FaceGen mesh (or just checks its file size, if that’s all you asked for) and shows the results in the NPCs gallery. The numbers are cached, so the cost is paid only once per appearance.
* **Reporting Metrics** — which stats to show: **File Size**, **Polygons** (the triangle / “face” count), and/or **Vertices**.
* **Display Mode** — **TextOverlay** prints the numbers right on each mugshot; **Tooltip** shows a small indicator instead and reveals the full stats on hover.
* **Text Height (% of mugshot)** — how large the overlaid text is, relative to the tile.
* **Highlight Criterion** — how the numbers are colored so heavy meshes jump out. **Spectrum** (shown) fades each value across a configurable **Low → Mid → High** color gradient, so the heaviest meshes glow red; other modes instead flag the heaviest few percent of tiles, or anything past a set threshold.
* **Clear FaceGen Analysis Cache** — discards the stored measurements so they’re recalculated the next time you view them.

### EasyNPC Transfer

![EasyNPC Transfer](docs/Screenshots/Settings/EasyNPC_Transfer_Section.png)

Tools for moving appearance choices between N.P.C.2 and EasyNPC. (EasyNPC selects *plugins*, while N.P.C.2 selects *mods*, so the conversion does some matching.)

* **Import NPC Appearance Choices from EasyNPC Profile**: Loads selections from an exported EasyNPC profile, matching its plugin choices to your available mods.
* **Export NPC Appearance Choices To New EasyNPC Profile**: Converts your mod selections into a fresh EasyNPC profile. Default Plugins are chosen from your conflict-winning records. (FaceGen-only mods can’t be exported because they have no plugin.)
* **Update Existing EasyNPC Profile**: Like the export, but keeps the Default Plugins from the file you select and only changes the appearance plugin. **Add Missing NPCs?** adds any NPCs you’ve chosen that weren’t already in that profile.
* **NPC Default Plugin Exclusions**: Plugins checked here are never chosen as EasyNPC “Default Plugins” during export — useful if you don’t want Synthesis/zEdit outputs serving as defaults.


### Load Order Import Settings

![Load Order Import](docs/Screenshots/Settings/Load_Order_Import_Section.png)

* **Import Choices from Load Order Exclusions**: When you use **Get from Load Order** in the NPCs tab to auto-derive your appearance choices, any plugins checked here are skipped as winning overrides — N.P.C.2 picks the next override down the conflict chain instead. (By default the base masters are checked so they aren’t treated as appearance mods.)


### Mod Import Settings

![Mod Import Settings](docs/Screenshots/Settings/Mod_Import_Settings.png)

Two lists that control N.P.C.2’s analysis of your mod folder, plus a viewer for the NPCs that analysis threw away.

* **Non-Appearance Mods**: Mods that N.P.C.2 decided don’t add or change any NPC appearances. Mouse over an entry to see *why* it was excluded. If N.P.C.2 got it wrong (or a mod updated and now does provide NPCs), click the entry’s re-scan icon or the **X** to remove it so it gets re-analyzed on the next launch.
* **Ignored Mods**: A list you control of mod folders to skip entirely during import. Use **Add Folder(s)...** to add them; remove a mod from the list to allow it back in.
* **Rejected NPCs**: Individual NPCs that *were* found in your mods but didn’t make it into the NPCs menu — no FaceGen, a template chain ending in a Leveled NPC, a race that isn’t a playable-style NPC race, and so on. Expand this panel for a Mod → NPC tree; click a mod to see the breakdown of reasons for that mod, or an NPC to see its exact reason plus its EditorID / FormKey. The filter box searches mod names, NPC names, EditorIDs, FormKeys, and reason text, so you can answer “why isn’t *this* NPC in the list?” directly. This reads the **`Rejected NPCs`** folder next to the .exe, which is rewritten when your mods are analyzed — after a re-scan, click **Refresh**.

![Rejected NPCs viewer](docs/Screenshots/Settings/Rejected_NPCs_Viewer.png)


### Spawn Bat File Options

![Spawn Bat File Options](docs/Screenshots/Settings/Spawn_Bat_File_Options.png)

Options for the in-game spawn `.bat` files N.P.C.2 can generate from the Run tab.

* **Console Commands Before Spawning**: Commands inserted before the `player.placeatme` lines.
* **Console Commands After Spawning**: Commands inserted after them. (The author likes to add `tai` here so the spawned NPCs hold still long enough to inspect.)


### Logging

![Logging](docs/Screenshots/Settings/Logging_Section_Formkey_Typed_in_Searchbar.png)

Diagnostic logging for troubleshooting.

N.P.C. 2's diagnostic logs are written as **HTML files** — open them in any web browser. Each log page has a filter box, a "Problems only" toggle, and collapsible sections, and warnings/errors are color-coded.

* **Log Activity**: Writes a general activity trace to **`EventLog.html`** in the application folder (the folder that holds the .exe).
* **Log Startup**: Writes a phased startup trace — environment resolution and the full mod-loading pipeline — to **`StartupLog.html`** in the application folder. (You can also turn this on without opening Settings by dropping an empty file named **`LogStartup.txt`** next to the .exe.)
* **Per-NPC Patch / Validation Logs**: For any NPC you add here, the Validator and Patcher write a complete per-NPC trace (every change to the record plus the dependency merge-in logic) to `NPC Logs\{NPC}.html` next to the app. Search by name, EditorID, or FormKey (the screenshot shows a FormKey typed in) and click a result to add it. This is the best tool for figuring out why a specific NPC didn’t come out right.
* **Log Asset Provenance**: Writes **`AssetProvenance.csv`** next to the .exe on the next run — one row per asset file copied into your output, naming the NPC and mod it came for, the record that pulled it in, and whether it came from a loose file or a BSA. Open it in a spreadsheet and sort by any column. This is the tool for “why is *this* texture in my output?”
* **Log Record Provenance**: The same idea for records rather than files. Writes **`RecordProvenance.csv`**, one row per non-NPC record merged into the output plugin, with the reference chain that dragged it in — so you can trace an unexpected record (or an unexpected master) back to the NPC that caused it. Pairs well with [Analyze Masters](#analyze-masters).

Both provenance logs take effect on the next Run; no restart needed.


## NPCs Menu

This is where you actually choose each NPC’s appearance. The left panel lists your NPCs; the main area shows a gallery of mugshots — one per appearance mod that provides the selected NPC.

![NPCs Menu](docs/Screenshots/NPCs/Full_Menu.png)

The toolbar across the top is grouped into sections, covered below. Each group is collapsible: click its caption and the contents fold away, leaving just the caption and reclaiming the width. That matters on smaller or scaled displays — collapsing **Show** alone is usually enough to keep the whole toolbar on a single row at 1920×1080 with 150% scaling, where it would otherwise wrap. Your collapsed groups are remembered between sessions, as is the position of the splitter between the NPC list and the gallery (in this tab and in the Mods tab).

![NPCs toolbar with most groups collapsed](docs/Screenshots/NPCs/Full_Menu_Collapsed.png)

*The same toolbar with every group but NPC Groups collapsed — the whole bar fits one row.*

### NPC Groups

![NPC Groups](docs/Screenshots/NPCs/NPC_Groups.png)

Groups let you operate on a subset of NPCs (e.g. when patching or making spawn `.bat` files). Type a name into the box to make a new group, or pick an existing one from the dropdown, then:

* **Add / Remove Current**: Adds or removes the currently selected NPC.
* **Add / Remove Visible**: Adds or removes every NPC currently visible in the left panel under your active filters.

### Show

![Show toggles](docs/Screenshots/NPCs/Show_Visibility.png)

Visibility toggles for the NPC list:

* **Single-Option NPCs**: NPCs that only have one appearance source (nothing to choose between). Hide them to focus on the meaningful decisions.
* **Unloaded NPCs**: NPCs not in your current load order (e.g. ones you only have a mugshot pack for, or that live in your separate appearance-mods folder). Useful when you want to copy their appearance onto an NPC that *is* loaded.
* **SkyPatcher Templates**: Shows NPCs that exist as SkyPatcher template targets.
* **Hidden Mods**: Reveals mugshots you’ve hidden via the right-click menu (so you can un-hide them).
* **Uninstalled Mods**: Shows mugshots for mods you don’t currently have installed (selectable as placeholders).
* **NPC Descriptions**: Toggles the short lore description shown at the bottom for the selected NPC (sourced from UESP / the Elder Scrolls Wiki — requires an internet connection). For non-vanilla NPCs you can supply your own descriptions via `.json` files in the `DescriptionOverrides` folder (see `ExampleOverride.json`).

### NPC Appearance Selections

![Selections options](docs/Screenshots/NPCs/Selections_Options.png)

Bulk actions on your whole set of choices:

* **Get from Load Order**: Scans your load order to figure out which mods you’re currently using as appearance mods, and selects them automatically (respecting the Load Order Import exclusions in Settings).
* **Randomize**: Opens the [Randomize window](#randomizing-appearances) to assign random appearances.
* **Export** / **Import**: Back up your selections to a `.json` file and restore them later. (This file is N.P.C.2-specific — it is *not* cross-compatible with EasyNPC; use the Settings tab for that.)
* **Clear**: Removes all selections so you can start fresh.

### Selected Mugshots

![Mugshot actions](docs/Screenshots/NPCs/Mugshot_Action_Options.png)

These act on the mugshots you’ve check-marked (using the checkbox in each tile’s top-right corner):

![Checkbox selection](docs/Screenshots/NPCs/Multiple_Mugshot_Checkbox_Selection.png)

* **Compare**: Opens the check-marked mugshots side-by-side in full screen so you can judge them head-to-head, ignoring the ones you don’t care about.

![Full-screen comparison](docs/Screenshots/NPCs/Multiple_Mugshot_Fulscreen_Comparison.png)

* **Hide/Unhide**: Hides the check-marked mugshots (or restores them if you’re viewing hidden mods). Hidden mugshots stay out of your way until you want them back.
* **Deselect all**: Clears all the check marks.

### Submenus

![Submenus](docs/Screenshots/NPCs/Submenus_Options_Currently_Just_Favorites.png)

Currently this group holds a single button, **Favorites**, which opens the [Favorite Faces window](#favorite-faces).

### Searching & Filtering

![Search filter options](docs/Screenshots/NPCs/Search_Filter_Options.png)

The filter rows above the NPC list let you narrow down which NPCs are shown. Each row has a dropdown picking *what* to match on, plus a value box, and a **Not** checkbox in front of the dropdown that inverts just that row (so `Not` + `In Appearance Mod` + `Bijin` keeps the NPCs that mod *doesn't* provide). Ticking **Not** on a row that isn't filtering anything — an empty value box, or **Group** left on *All NPCs* — still does nothing; inverting "no filter" is "no filter". You can combine two rows with **AND (Match All)** or **OR (Match Any)**, and **Sort By** / **Reverse** to order the list. The match fields include:

* **Name** / **EditorID** / **FormKey** / **FormID** — identifiers for the NPC.
* **In Appearance Mod** — NPCs provided by a given mod.
* **Chosen In Mod** — NPCs for which you’ve selected a given mod.
* **From Plugin** — the plugin the NPC is defined in.
* **Selection State** — whether or not you’ve made a choice.
* **Shared/Guest Appearance** — NPCs using a shared appearance.
* **Race** — the NPC’s race, taken from its conflict-winning record. This one gets an editable dropdown listing every race present in your NPC list as `Name (EditorID)`; pick an entry, or type your own text. Matching is partial by default and checks the race’s Name *and* EditorID, so `nord` catches every Nord variant. Append `~` for an exact whole-string match — `NordRace~` matches only `NordRace`, excluding `NordRaceVampire`.
* **Uniqueness** / **Gender** / **Group** / **Template** — other categorizations.

Press **Ctrl+Shift+C** at any time to clear the filters and get the whole list back. It works from anywhere in the window, including while the caret is still in a search box, and it clears whichever search menu is on screen — the NPCs tab, the [Mods tab](#filtering), or the [Favorite Faces window](#favorite-faces). Your field dropdowns and the AND/OR choice are left as you set them, so only the values are wiped. The exception is a row set to **Selection State**, **Shared/Guest Appearance** or **Template**: every option in those dropdowns is a real filter with no "any" setting, so such a row also reverts to its default field — otherwise "clear" would leave the list still filtered.

### The NPC List

The left panel is your list of NPCs. Hover an entry to see its full details (name, EditorID, FormKey, FormID, and group membership):

![Name tooltip](docs/Screenshots/NPCs/NPC_List_Mouseover_Name_Tooltip.png)

Some NPCs show small purple **T** badges, which indicate template relationships (one NPC borrowing another’s appearance via the game’s “template” mechanic). Hovering each badge explains the relationship — whether this NPC is the winning template source for another NPC, or is referenced as a template source by one:

![Template source tooltip](docs/Screenshots/NPCs/NPC_List_Mouseover_TemplateSource_Tooltip.png)

![Referenced as template source tooltip](docs/Screenshots/NPCs/NPC_List_Mouseover_TemplateSourceBy_Tooltip.png)

**Right-clicking an NPC** in the list opens a context menu with per-NPC options:

* **Include Outfits** — whether the chosen appearance mod’s outfit is applied to this NPC: use the mod’s own setting, always include, or never include.

![Outfits context menu](docs/Screenshots/NPCs/NpcList_Rightclick_Context_Outfits.png)

* **Render** — per-NPC overrides for how this NPC’s auto-generated mugshot/3D render is composed. By default it simply reflects your global render settings (from the Settings tab). To make *this one NPC* different, first check **Override Global Setting** — until you do, the **Include Default Outfit** and **Include Headgear** options stay greyed out. Once it’s checked, toggle those two on or off to control whether this NPC is rendered in its outfit and/or headgear.

![Render context menu](docs/Screenshots/NPCs/NpcList_Rightclick_Context_RenderOptions.png)

* **Add Face from Favorites** — apply a face from your Favorites library.
* **Copy** — copies this NPC’s **FormID** or **FormKey** straight to the clipboard, for pasting into xEdit, a console command, or a bug report. FormID is greyed out for NPCs whose plugin isn’t in your load order, since it can’t be resolved without one. Be aware that a FormID’s leading digits are the plugin’s load order index, so for anything but `Skyrim.esm` the value changes whenever your load order does — FormKey is the stable identifier.
* **Jump to Template Reference** — jump to an NPC involved in this NPC’s template relationships.

![Templates context menu](docs/Screenshots/NPCs/NpcList_Rightclick_Context_Templates.png)

### Making a Selection

To choose an appearance, click its mugshot (or placeholder). The tile gets a colored border indicating the result:

* **Green border** — the mod is installed and the selection is valid.

![Green border selection](docs/Screenshots/NPCs/Selection_Made_Green_Border.png)

* **Purple border** — you’ve selected a mugshot whose mod isn’t actually installed. You can still make the selection, but that NPC will be skipped at patch time until you install the corresponding mod.

![Purple border selection](docs/Screenshots/NPCs/Selection_Made_Purple_Border.png)

If a mod provides an appearance but you have no mugshot for it, you’ll see a generic helmet **placeholder** instead — it works exactly like a real mugshot for selection purposes:

![Placeholder mugshot](docs/Screenshots/NPCs/Placeholder_Mugshot.png)

### Choosing Which Mugshot Source To Show

![Mugshot source quick toggle](docs/Screenshots/NPCs/Mugshot_Source_Quick_Toggle.png)

At the bottom of the gallery, the **Mugshot Source** toggle lets you override, for the NPC you’re looking at, which source the gallery draws from: **MD** = Manually Downloaded (curated) mugshots, **FF** = FaceFinder, **AG** = Auto-Generated. With none selected, N.P.C.2 uses your default priority order from Settings — which can show a mix of curated and generated images:

![Default mixed priority](docs/Screenshots/NPCs/No_MugshotSource_Selected_Default_Priority_Mixed_Curated_Autogen.png)

Selecting **AG** forces the gallery to show the app’s own renders wherever it has the mod data to produce them — handy for an apples-to-apples comparison under identical lighting:

![Auto-gen source selected](docs/Screenshots/NPCs/Autogen_MugshotSource_Selected_Shows_Autogen_Where_LocalData_Exists.png)

### Mugshot Right-Click Menu

![Mugshot context menu](docs/Screenshots/NPCs/Mugshot_RightClick_ContextMenu.png)

Right-clicking a mugshot opens a rich context menu:

* **Select / Hide / Unhide** — same as clicking the tile, or the Hide/Unhide button.
* **Select All / Available / Visible From This Mod** (and the matching **Unselect** entries) — apply (or remove) this mod across many NPCs at once: all NPCs it provides, only those you haven’t chosen yet (“Available”), only those currently visible under your filters, etc. This is the “choose this mod for everything it provides” power feature.
* **Hide All / Unhide All From This Mod** — bulk hide or reveal every mugshot from this mod.
* **Jump to Mod** — switch to the Mods tab focused on this mod.
* **Show Full Image (Ctrl+RClick)** — full-screen view of the mugshot.
* **Show 3D Preview (Ctrl+Shift+RClick)** — opens the interactive [3D preview](#3d-preview).
* **Generate Mugshot** — renders *this one* appearance with the built-in 3D renderer, right now. It works whether or not **Auto-Generate missing mugshots** is switched on, so you don't have to detour through Settings to render a single NPC and then switch it off again. It always re-renders, even if a render already exists, which makes it the right button after you've fixed a mod's folders. (Hidden for mods you don't have installed — there's no data to render.)
* **Delete Mugshot** — deletes the image the tile is *currently showing*, and says which of the three sources that is (Downloaded / FaceFinder / Auto-Generated) so you can't delete the wrong one by accident. The tile then falls back to whatever ranks next, or to the placeholder. Empty folders left behind are cleaned up, and N.P.C.2 asks first — a **downloaded** mugshot is the one kind it can't recreate for you.
* **Share with NPC** — make this appearance available to a *different* NPC (see below).
* **Add to Favorites** — save this face to your [Favorites](#favorite-faces) library.
* **Open Mod Folder / Open Mugshot Folder / Visit Mod Page** — quick links to the files on disk or the mod’s web page.

### Sharing an Appearance Between NPCs

One of N.P.C.2’s signature features: you can take any NPC’s appearance and use it on another NPC. Right-click the mugshot whose look you want and choose **Share with NPC**:

![Share step 1](docs/Screenshots/NPCs/AppearanceShare_Step1_RightClickContext.png)

In the window that appears, search for the NPC you want to give that appearance to. **Share and Select** applies the appearance immediately; **Share** just makes it *available* in that NPC’s gallery without selecting it yet (so you can compare it against other options first):

![Share step 2](docs/Screenshots/NPCs/AppearanceShare_Step2_ChooseTargetNPC.png)

Afterward, the shared mugshot appears in the target NPC’s gallery, and hovering it explains whose appearance it is:

![Share step 3](docs/Screenshots/NPCs/AppearanceShare_Step3_ShareTooltipDisplayed.png)

One NPC you won’t find in the picker is the appearance’s own source — sharing a face with the NPC it already belongs to would just duplicate that NPC’s native appearance, and the resulting entry couldn’t be undone. The same applies to **Make Available** on a favorite of the NPC you’re currently looking at, which tells you so rather than appearing to do nothing.

### Mugshot Symbols

Mugshots can carry small icons in their corners that flag special states. Hover any of them for details.

* **Helmet placeholder** — no mugshot image exists for this mod/NPC (covered above).

* **Purple floppy-disk icon** — you have the mugshot but not the mod. You can select it as a placeholder, but the NPC won’t be included in the output until the real mod is installed.

![Purple floppy tooltip](docs/Screenshots/NPCs/Purple_Floppy_Icon_Tooltip_No_Mod_Data.png)

* **Purple wall-plug icon** — this mod provides the NPC through more than one plugin. Right-click and use **Select Source Plugin** to pick which one supplies this NPC’s record.

![Wall-plug select source plugin](docs/Screenshots/NPCs/Purple_WallPlug_Icon_ContextMenu_SelectSourcePlugin.png)

* **Red missing-assets icon** — appears only on **auto-generated** mugshots. When N.P.C.2 rendered this appearance itself, some required asset files (textures/meshes) couldn’t be found; the tooltip lists the exact missing paths. Curated/downloaded mugshots never show it, since they’re pre-made images N.P.C.2 doesn’t render.

    Textures are reported per *shape* rather than per file, and only when a shape has **no** usable texture at all — which is the case that visibly renders untextured. A single dead texture slot is ignored: mods ship those constantly (an absent mouth subsurface map is near-universal), and flagging each one buried the findings that mattered under noise nobody could act on. A texture counts as found if the engine could load it from anywhere — the mod, your game folder, or the vanilla archives — so mods reusing vanilla textures aren’t reported. This is how a case like Adrianne Avenicci surfaces: her face renders correctly but her hair, brow and eye textures are absent, because those head parts carry their own TextureSets that the chosen add-on doesn’t ship.

![Red missing assets tooltip](docs/Screenshots/NPCs/Red_Missing_Assets_Icon_Tooltip.png)

* **Missing outfit-assets icon** — the sibling of the one above, for the *attire* rather than the NPC. It appears when the rendered outfit or headgear is missing meshes or textures (install them and the mugshot re-renders with them filled in), and/or when an outfit mesh points at an SMP/HDT physics config file that doesn’t exist inside the mod — the latter is purely informational, since the render itself is correct and nothing you install can fix a broken link inside someone else’s mod. The tooltip separates the two. Both this icon and the base missing-assets icon can be switched off under [Auto-Generation](#auto-generation-built-in-3d-renderer) → Warning Icons.

![Missing outfit assets tooltip](docs/Screenshots/NPCs/Missing_Outfit_Assets_Icon_Tooltip.png)

* **“!” template indicator** — this NPC inherits its face from another NPC via Skyrim’s template system. Its colour tells you whether that matters: **red** means your selection genuinely won’t apply — the game will show the template’s face no matter what you pick here — while **amber** means the [Templated NPCs](#output-settings) setting is on *Give each NPC its own copy*, so the mod you choose really will be used for this NPC. Hover it either way; the tooltip is written for the situation you’re actually in. Chains ending in a levelled list stay red in both modes, because the game picks the actor at runtime and there is no fixed face to copy. The badge is drawn when tiles are built, so switching modes repaints it the next time you select an NPC.

![Amber template badge tooltip](docs/Screenshots/NPCs/Template_Badge_Amber_Tooltip.png)

    These NPCs used to show nothing but a helmet placeholder, since they own no face of their own for the renderer to draw. N.P.C.2 now follows the template chain and renders the face the NPC will actually wear, resolved through each tile’s own mod — so two mods can legitimately disagree if one of them re-points the template. Only chains that can’t be followed (a levelled-list terminus, a broken link, a loop) still fall back to the placeholder.

* **“No NPC record” icon** — this mod ships a FaceGen file for the NPC but no plugin record for it. N.P.C.2 still offers the appearance: it inherits the record from the NPC’s original plugin and applies just this mod’s face mesh and textures. Worth hovering, because it can also mean the mod author forgot to include the record — and if the FaceGen was built against different head parts than the original record specifies, the face can come out wrong in game.

![No NPC record tooltip](docs/Screenshots/NPCs/No_Npc_Record_Icon_Tooltip.png)

* **“Has Wig” badge** (top-left) — this NPC wears a wig supplied by this mod, either in its skin/worn armor or in its Default Outfit. It tells you the face you’re looking at includes a wig, which is what the [Head Editing](#head-editing-wigs--antlers) settings act on. The tooltip names each wig record it found. Mugshots always *show* an outfit wig, whatever the Wig Handling Mode and whatever the Include Headgear setting — a wig is the character’s hair, not a hat you’d want toggled away.
    * **Crossed out with a red X** — that wig won’t make it into your output. This happens when the mod’s Wig Handling Mode is *Leave As Is* **and** Include Outfits is off for the NPC, so nothing carries the wig across; in game they’d have their own hair instead of the face you’re looking at. The tooltip says how to keep it: pick a Wig Handling Mode, or turn on Include Outfits. (In plain *Create* output mode wig handling can’t run at all, so the tooltip points you at the output mode instead.) Skin-carried wigs travel with the appearance and are never crossed out.

![Crossed-out Has Wig badge tooltip](docs/Screenshots/NPCs/Has_Wig_Badge_Tooltip_Crossed.png)

![Has Wig badge tooltip](docs/Screenshots/NPCs/Has_Wig_Badge_Tooltip.png)

* **“No Antlers” badge** (top-left) — this mod’s Antler Handling Mode is *Remove* and this NPC actually carries antlers that the patch will strip, so the picture you’re looking at is showing you the antler-free result. With any other mode, mugshots always *show* an outfit’s antlers, whatever the Include Outfit and Include Headgear settings — like a wig, antlers are part of the face the mod gives the NPC rather than a hat you’d want toggled away.

![No Antlers badge tooltip](docs/Screenshots/NPCs/No_Antlers_Badge_Tooltip.png)

* **Orange ⚠ outfit-conflict badge** — the outfit you asked N.P.C.2 to include for this NPC will be overridden at runtime by a SkyPatcher or SPID config in your load order (or, in SkyPatcher Mode, N.P.C.2’s own outfit entry loses to a later-loading config). The tooltip names the winning config file and line. See [Which outfit does the preview wear?](#which-outfit-does-the-preview-wear) for the full resolution rules.

![Runtime outfit conflict badge tooltip](docs/Screenshots/NPCs/Runtime_Outfit_Conflict_Badge_Tooltip.png)

* **Share badge** — marks an appearance involved in [sharing](#sharing-an-appearance-between-npcs). The same silhouette appears in two colors, one for each direction. One color means the appearance was **shared *to* this NPC** from another — selecting it applies that look, and the tooltip names the donor. The other color means this mugshot’s appearance has been **shared *out* to another NPC** — hovering names the recipient.

![Shared-from tooltip](docs/Screenshots/NPCs/Share_Icon_Blue_Tooltip_SharedFrom.png)

![Shared-with tooltip](docs/Screenshots/NPCs/Share_Icon_Blue_Tooltip_SharedWith.png)

Sharing also works for NPCs handled via SkyPatcher templates — the tooltip spells out which appearance is being applied to whom:

![SkyPatcher shared tooltip](docs/Screenshots/NPCs/NPC_From_Skypatcher_Tooltip_As_Shared.png)

* **Teal “CR” badge** — this one is *not* an N.P.C.2 indicator. It’s baked into the image itself by the FaceFinder service and marks a face that was built with Charmers of the Reach (CotR). It has no effect on anything in N.P.C.2 and can be safely ignored.

### FaceGen Stats Overlay

If you turn on [FaceGen Analysis](#facegen-analysis) in Settings, each mugshot is labeled with its FaceGen geometry stats — here the polygon (**Faces**) count and file **Size** — color-graded so the heaviest head/hair meshes stand out (in the default spectrum, light meshes read blue and heavy ones red). It’s an easy way to catch an appearance whose mesh is wildly more expensive than its neighbors before you commit to it.

![FaceGen stats overlaid on the gallery](docs/Screenshots/NPCs/FaceGen_Analysis_Overlay.png)

### Drag-and-Drop Actions

Two gallery actions work by dragging mugshots around:

**Drag a mugshot and a placeholder together** — links the mugshot to the placeholder’s mod, so that mod shows the image everywhere it appears (not just the current NPC). Use it when a downloaded mugshot pack’s folder name doesn’t match your mod’s name, so N.P.C.2 didn’t link them on its own. The action is valid whenever one tile is a **mugshot with no game data** (a curated *or* FaceFinder image whose mod you don’t have installed) and the other is a **tile backed by game data but with no curated/FaceFinder mugshot of its own** — either a blank helmet placeholder *or* a tile currently showing an auto-generated render. **It doesn’t matter which you drag onto which.**

![Dragging a mugshot onto a placeholder](docs/Screenshots/NPCs/DragDrop_Mugshot_Onto_Placeholder.gif)

**Drag a mugshot onto another mugshot** — for every NPC where the *drop-target* mod is currently selected, swaps the selection to the *dropped* mod (wherever it provides that NPC) — i.e. the dropped mod “gives the old one the boot.”

### NPC Description

![NPC description](docs/Screenshots/NPCs/NPC_Description_Text.png)

When **Show NPC Descriptions** is on, a short bio of the selected NPC appears at the bottom of the screen — helpful for deciding what an NPC *should* look like when you don’t remember who they are.

### 3D Preview

![3D preview window](docs/Screenshots/NPCs/Show_3D_Preview_Window.png)

The **Show 3D Preview** option (or Ctrl+Shift+RClick on a mugshot) opens an interactive 3D render of the NPC as that appearance mod would make them. You can spin the model and tune lighting, camera FOV, color grading, and skin shading — the same controls described under [Auto-Generation](#auto-generation-built-in-3d-renderer) — and toggle whether they’re shown in their default outfit and/or headgear, to inspect the appearance far more closely than a static mugshot allows.

With the outfit toggle on, the preview dresses the NPC in the outfit they’ll *actually wear in game* given your patching mode, the Include Outfit setting, and any SkyPatcher/SPID outfit distribution in your load order — see [Which outfit does the preview wear?](#which-outfit-does-the-preview-wear). If a runtime config defeats an outfit you asked N.P.C.2 to include, a warning banner in the preview names the config responsible; otherwise the status line at the bottom notes where a distributed outfit came from. Banners in the top-right corner likewise flag missing outfit assets and antler removal, matching the [badges](#mugshot-symbols) on the mugshot tile.

![3D preview with a runtime outfit override banner](docs/Screenshots/NPCs/Render_Include_Outfit_Overwrite_Warning.png)

*The banner at the bottom names the SPID config (file and line) that will override the Include Outfit request at runtime — the preview is already dressed in the outfit that actually wins.*

The preview also reflects [Head Editing](#head-editing-wigs--antlers): a wig that will be forwarded or converted is shown the way the patched NPC will look, and antlers that *Remove* will strip are hidden. Outfit antlers under any other mode follow the same split as wigs — the preview treats them as the ordinary outfit piece they are (so they obey Include Headgear), while the mugshot tile draws them regardless.

Unlike the mugshot, the preview stays strictly faithful to your output here. A wig the patch *won’t* carry across (Wig Handling Mode *Leave As Is* with Include Outfits off) behaves like the ordinary outfit piece it is — it follows the Include Headgear toggle — and a banner tells you the mod supplies a wig you aren’t getting, and how to keep it. The mugshot tile answers the same question the other way round: it draws the wig and puts a red X on its [Has Wig badge](#mugshot-symbols).

#### Correcting what counts as a wig or an antler

N.P.C.2’s scan finds most wigs and antlers on its own, but it can’t catch everything — antler head parts with non-obvious names slip past the keyword check, and an occasional hair mesh gets flagged as a wig when it isn’t. Two buttons in the top-left of the per-mugshot 3D preview let you fix that by hand, using the model in front of you.

**Set Wig Meshes** (shown only when the NPC’s worn armor carries hair-slot meshes) lists those meshes. Hover a row to highlight that mesh in the viewport; check it to declare it a wig, or uncheck an auto-detected row (marked *auto*) to veto a false positive.

![Set Wig Meshes selector](docs/Screenshots/NPCs/Preview_Set_Wig_Meshes_Selector.png)

**Set Antler Head Parts** lists the NPC’s head parts. Hover a row to highlight the corresponding shape in the viewport. Check a whole head part to remove it outright; where a head part has sub-shapes (the common case being antlers baked onto the *hair* as extra parts), each sub-shape is listed underneath and can be stripped on its own, leaving the rest of the head part intact. Rows marked *auto* were keyword-detected and are always removed when the mode is *Remove*.

![Set Antler Head Parts selector](docs/Screenshots/NPCs/Preview_Set_Antler_HeadParts_Selector.png)

Designations are saved and take effect immediately — the preview rebuilds so you can see the result. How widely each one applies is set by **Manual Wig Designation Scope** / **Manual Antler Block Scope** in [Head Editing](#head-editing-wigs--antlers). In both cases the designation only marks the mesh; it’s still the mod’s Wig/Antler Handling Mode that decides whether anything is actually done with it.

### Favorite Faces

![Favorites window](docs/Screenshots/NPCs/Favorites_Window.png)

The **Favorites** button (under Submenus) opens your library of bookmarked faces. Any mugshot you **Add to Favorites** lands here, labeled with the NPC and the source mod. From this window you can **Apply** a favorite to the current NPC, **Make Available** (add it as a selectable option without selecting it), **Share with NPC**, or **Remove** it from the library. The typical use case: an NPC has several mods offering appearances you like, but you can only pick one of them. Save the runners-up to Favorites, then later share those “also loved but didn’t pick” faces onto other NPCs you think they’d suit.

Once the library gets big, the boxes at the top make it manageable — they’re the same controls as the NPCs tab, adapted to saved faces:

* **Filter**: three configurable search rows combined with **AND (Match All)** or **OR (Match Any)**, plus a **Clear** button (or **Ctrl+Shift+C**, as on the [NPCs tab](#searching--filtering) — the button and the shortcut do the same thing). Each row has the same per-row **Not** checkbox as the [NPC filter](#searching--filtering). The fields are the ones that mean something for a saved face: **Name**, **EditorID**, **FormKey**, **Mod**, **Race** (with the same editable dropdown and `~` exact-match syntax as the NPC filter), **Gender**, **Uniqueness**, and **Group**.
* **Favorite Groups**: named groups for your favorites, with **Add**/**Remove Current** and **Add**/**Remove Visible** buttons that work exactly like the [NPC Groups](#npc-groups) box. These are a separate namespace from NPC groups and are keyed per favorite, so the same NPC favorited from two different mods can be grouped independently — handy for sorting a big library into “Nord women I like”, “candidates for bandits”, and so on.
* **Batch Actions**: **Add**/**Remove All From Mod** opens a small picker listing your installed mods, and favorites (or un-favorites) every appearance that mod provides in one step. Each entry shows how many appearances the mod has and how many are already favorited; the **Remove** picker lists only mods you actually have favorites from. Handy for pulling a whole appearance pack into the library to browse and share from, without clicking every tile.

### Randomizing Appearances

![Randomize window](docs/Screenshots/NPCs/Randomize_Window.png)

The **Randomize** button bulk-assigns random appearances. You can scope it to the visible (filtered) NPCs or all NPCs, control whether base and shared appearances are allowed (and how shares are matched — by race, gender, weight), decide whether NPCs that end up with only one eligible appearance are assigned it or left alone (**Allow single-option NPCs**, off by default), pick the appearance source (mods, favorites, or both), and tick exactly which mods are eligible to draw from. **Randomize** applies the assignment; **Clear Randomized NPCs** reverts it.

### Zoom Controls

![Zoom controls](docs/Screenshots/NPCs/Zoom_Controls.png)

When you select an NPC, N.P.C.2 fits as many mugshots on screen as it can (up to the **Max # Mugshots To Fit** setting). From there you can zoom in/out. **Lock Zoom** keeps the current zoom level for every NPC you visit; **Reset Zoom** returns to fit-on-screen.


## Mods Menu

The Mods tab lists every selectable appearance “mod” with batch settings, and lets you browse all the NPCs each mod contains.

![Mods overview and color coding](docs/Screenshots/Mods/Overview_And_ColorCoding.png)

### Color Coding

The colored left-border of each mod entry indicates its status:

* **Green** — mod data is available and mugshots are linked. Ready to use.
* **Purple** — mugshots exist but the mod data isn’t available (selectable as a placeholder; the patcher will skip NPCs you select it for until you install it). This matches the purple selection border in the NPCs menu, which likewise means "you have a mugshot, but the mod isn’t installed."
* **Orange** — data is available but you don’t have mugshots for it (still fully usable for patching; you just won’t see a face preview, unless you turn on [mugshot auto-generation](#auto-generation-built-in-3d-renderer)).
* **Grey** — no data and no mugshots. A red **Delete** button appears so you can remove the orphaned entry.

The two synthetic entries **Base Game** and **Creation Club** appear here too. They represent vanilla and Creation Club content, have a reduced set of controls, and are always treated as having their data available.

Click a mod’s **name** to load its NPCs’ mugshots in the right panel (this can take a moment for large mods; a **Cancel Mugshot Load** button appears while it works).

### Filtering

![Filtering options](docs/Screenshots/Mods/Filtering_Options.png)

* **Filter Name** / **Filter Plugin** — narrow the list by mod display name or plugin filename.
* **Filter NPC** — show only mods that provide a particular NPC.
* **Show Mugshot-Only Mods** — include mods that supply only mugshots (no resource folders).

**Ctrl+Shift+C** empties all three filter boxes at once, exactly as it does on the [NPCs tab](#searching--filtering).

### Per-Mod Settings

![Per-mod settings](docs/Screenshots/Mods/Per_Mod_Setting.png)

Each mod entry exposes:

* **Mugshot Folders** — folder(s) of preview images for this mod. (You can also set this by drag-and-drop, below.)
* **Corresponding Mod Folder Paths** — the folder(s) where this mod’s actual resources (plugins, meshes, textures) live. By default this is just the mod’s own folder. **Add** more folders when a separate mod is needed as a resource and you want it merged in rather than left as a master (e.g. High Poly Head, Better Argonian Horns). Use **Browse...** to change a path and **X** to remove one. Each folder past the first also has a small **padlock** toggle: a locked folder survives a **Refresh** instead of being dropped when N.P.C.2 rebuilds the list from the mod's masters. Folders you add by hand start out locked, since a manual add is by definition something the automatic detection didn't find — so the silent dependencies described under [Resource Folder Detection](#resource-folder-detection) now stay put. (The mod's own primary folder has no toggle; the rebuild is anchored on it, so it's never at risk.)
* **Merge Dependencies** — whether records referenced by the NPC are merged into the output plugin. Leave it **unchecked** for a mod that merely *defines* an NPC you want to forward (e.g. forwarding an NPC’s original look from Legacy of the Dragonborn) — otherwise the patcher tries to merge a huge chunk of that mod and may crash. Pure appearance replacers are fine to merge.
* **Copy Assets** — whether this mod’s non-plugin resources (textures, meshes, and the like *other than* FaceGen, which is always copied) are forwarded into the output folder. If you uncheck it, the mod’s assets must keep coming from your live setup instead, and N.P.C.2 tracks that for you: any referenced asset that lives inside a **BSA archive** gets that archive’s plugin added as a **master of the output plugin** (so the game itself refuses to run without it — the run log lists every master added this way), while referenced **loose files** are recorded in the run’s ledger and **Validate Output** warns if they later go missing. The same protection applies with Copy Assets *on* for assets a mod references from **outside its own folders** (e.g. a hair mod reusing the original KS Hairdos texture paths): they aren’t copied, so their supplying archive’s plugin is mastered in instead. The character previews resolve assets the same way, so what you see is what the game will load.
* **Include Outfits** — whether this mod’s NPC outfits are carried into the output (can also be set per-NPC from the NPCs tab). Note that a SkyPatcher or SPID config in your load order can still override an included outfit at runtime — the character previews simulate this and flag it with an orange ⚠ badge when it happens (see [Which outfit does the preview wear?](#which-outfit-does-the-preview-wear)).
* **Handle Injected Records** — also merge in this mod’s *injected* records. An injected record is one a mod slots into another plugin’s FormID space (for example, into Skyrim.esm’s) instead of its own — a common way for a replacer to add head parts without taking on a new master. Normally the patcher only merges records owned by the appearance mod’s own plugins; checking this makes it hunt down injected records as well. Most appearance mods don’t need it and it makes patching slower, so leave it off unless a specific mod requires it. If a mod does need it and it’s off, the pre-run screening says so by name and skips those NPCs rather than writing an output that references a record it never carried.
* **Set Keywords** and **Set Resource Plugins** — open their own dialogs, described just below.
* **Record Override Handling Mode** — how this mod’s *non-NPC* override records are handled (see [Record Override Handling](#record-override-handling)).
* **Wig Handling Mode** / **Antler Handling Mode** — per-mod overrides of the Head Editing defaults, described below.
* **Refresh** — re-analyze this mod (e.g. after changing its folders).

> **Most users never need to touch Merge Dependencies or Handle Injected Records** — N.P.C.2 sets them for you during the automatic mod import. If it decides a mod is a **base mod** (one with more non-appearance records than appearance ones, like the base game or Legacy of the Dragonborn), it **unchecks Merge Dependencies**; if it finds **injected records**, it **checks Handle Injected Records**. Whenever the analyzer has changed one of these from its default, that control’s label is highlighted in **purple** to flag it. Only adjust them by hand if the automatic classifier got it wrong — usually signalled by unexpected extra master files showing up in your output plugin.

#### Set Resource Plugins

![Set Resource-Only Plugins dialog](docs/Screenshots/Mods/Set_Resource_Plugins.png)

Marking a plugin as **resource-only** tells N.P.C.2: “this plugin supplies supporting records, but don’t treat its NPCs as belonging to this mod.” It matters whenever a mod’s folders pull in a plugin whose NPCs are already owned by a *different* mod entry.

The screenshot shows the exact case it’s built for. *Ordinary People - NPC Overhaul* has its own mod entry, which owns the NPCs that mod provides. Its *zExtended Addon* is installed as a separate mod, but it can’t stand on its own — it relies on the base *Ordinary People* plugin to supply head-part records. So the Addon’s mod entry lists **both** plugins as Corresponding Plugins. Left as-is, that would make the Addon entry re-advertise every NPC from base Ordinary People on top of the handful the Addon actually adds. Marking the base *Ordinary People* plugin as resource-only resolves this: it stays available as a dependency, but only the NPCs from the Addon plugin are counted as this mod’s own.

Like **Merge Dependencies** and **Handle Injected Records**, N.P.C.2’s import analyzer normally detects and marks resource-only plugins for you, so you’ll rarely need this dialog. If you suspect a plugin was marked incorrectly — most likely after upgrading settings from a version older than 2.1.9, when the auto-detection was less reliable — click **Refresh** to re-analyze the mod. If it still gets it wrong, open this dialog and set the resource-only plugins by hand.

#### Set Keywords

![Set Keywords dialog](docs/Screenshots/Mods/Set_Keywords.png)

**Set Keywords** lets you attach keywords to the NPCs this mod provides. Use the left pane to add/remove the mod’s current keywords (type one and click **Add**, or remove existing ones), and the right pane to pull in keywords already used by your other mods. These keywords are written onto the NPC records in the output — handy for tagging NPCs so other tools or runtime frameworks treat them a certain way (for example an “ignore”-style keyword that tells another appearance patcher to skip them).

### Resource Folder Detection

N.P.C.2 auto-detects most of a mod’s resource folders by reading its plugins: when a mod’s plugin lists plugins from *other* mods as masters, N.P.C.2 automatically pulls those mods in as **Corresponding Mod Folder Paths**. Often that catches everything the mod needs:

![Autodetected resource folders](docs/Screenshots/Mods/Mod_With_Autodetected_Resource_Folders.png)

But this master-based detection can’t catch a **plugin-independent** dependency — one a mod relies on purely for loose assets, with no plugin master reference to give it away. For example, *Modpocalypse NPCs (v4)* needs *Modpocalypse - Resources (v4)* only for its loose meshes and textures; because nothing in the plugin points to it, N.P.C.2 has no way to know it’s required, so you have to add it yourself. When such a “silent” dependency is missing, the affected NPCs render with **missing assets** (note the red icons and the bald heads, where the head/hair meshes couldn’t be found). A whole batch of auto-generated mugshots flagged with missing assets is a strong sign you’re missing a dependency like this:

![Missing assets](docs/Screenshots/Mods/Mod_With_ResourceFolder_Not_Autodetected_Missing_Assets.png)

Add the missing folder under **Corresponding Mod Folder Paths**, and the assets resolve — the mugshots render correctly. Because you added it by hand it comes in **locked**, so it will still be there after the next Refresh rather than being discarded when N.P.C.2 rebuilds the folder list from the mod's masters:

![Manually added, assets found](docs/Screenshots/Mods/Mod_With_ResourceFolder_Not_Autodetected_Added_Manually_Assets_Found.png)

### Record Override Handling

![Mod that needs override handling](docs/Screenshots/Mods/Mod_That_Needs_Record_Override_Handling.png)

A small number of appearance mods (e.g. RS Children Overhaul) also modify *non-NPC* records — like Races — and don’t work right without those changes. The **Record Override Handling Mode** dropdown controls this per-mod:

* **Ignore** — don’t carry the overrides (the default, and correct for almost every mod). If an NPC’s appearance actually relies on one of these overridden records, ignoring it can leave that NPC looking wrong in-game — for example a dark face bug — which is your cue to switch this mod to *Include*.
* **Include** — incorporate the changes (delta-patched into your winning records in *Create and Patch* mode, or copied directly in *Create* mode). Selecting **Include** reveals extra controls, described below.
* **Include As New** — copy the modified record as a brand-new record and point the NPC at it, avoiding conflicts with other mods that touch the original.

With *Include* or *Include As New* selected, three controls appear that shape the search for the mod's overridden records:

* **Max Nested Search Layers** — how long the search keeps going through records the mod *doesn't* override before giving up on that branch. It is **not** a total depth limit: the counter resets every time one of the mod's records is found, so a continuous chain of the mod's edits is always followed all the way down. The default of 2 is what lets the search cross one unrelated record (say, a vanilla outfit) to reach the mod's edits beneath it. Higher values find more obscure overrides but take exponentially longer.
* **Include All** — skip the search entirely and grab *every* override record in the mod's plugins, related to your NPCs or not. Use with caution.
* **Override Roots** — which *fields* of the NPC record the search is allowed to start from. By default these are the appearance-carrying fields (race, skin, face texture, hair color, head parts, outfits, template), and for almost every mod the default is right. The reason this is exposed: the search used to start from *every* link on the NPC record, including its AI packages — and from an AI package the walk reaches cells, quests, and other NPCs, so an appearance patch could end up quietly duplicating AI and quest data into your output. Rooting at the appearance fields stops that. A ticked field is still followed to unlimited depth through *any* record type, so this controls where the search begins, never what it may merge. If a mod's overrides live somewhere unusual, tick the extra field here (per mod, or set the global default next to the Settings tab's Override Handling Mode dropdown); if you see AI packages or quests showing up in your output's [Record Provenance](#logging) log, untick what you don't want followed.

![Override Roots dialog](docs/Screenshots/Mods/Override_Roots_Dialog.png)

Override handling is slow and can crash the patcher on big base mods, so **only enable it for the specific mods that visibly need it** (an NPC looks bugged in-game). See the FAQ for a deeper explanation of the trade-offs.

### Wig and Antler Handling (Per-Mod)

![Per-mod wig and antler handling dropdowns](docs/Screenshots/Mods/Wig_And_Antler_Handling_Mode.png)

When the mod analysis finds wigs or antlers in a mod, that mod’s row grows a **Wig Handling Mode** and/or **Antler Handling Mode** dropdown — plus **Converted Wig Hair Color** alongside the wig one. They offer the same choices as the global [Head Editing](#head-editing-wigs--antlers) settings, plus **Default**, which means “use the Settings tab’s value.” Mods with nothing detected don’t show the dropdowns at all, and neither appears when the current output mode makes them inert (plain *Create* mode).

The two are independent: a mod whose wigs you want forwarded to the skin but whose antlers you want gone is just *Forward To Skin* + *Remove*. Hover either label for a full description of each mode.

### Templated NPCs (Per-Mod)

Mods that contain [templated NPCs](#output-settings) grow a **Templated NPCs** dropdown in the same spot, overriding the global setting for just that mod's NPCs: **Default** (use the Settings tab's value), **Use the template's appearance**, or **Give each NPC its own copy**. Unlike the wig/antler dropdowns it shows in every output mode, because the setting applies in plain *Create* mode too.

## Mod Issues Menu

The Mod Issues tab finds appearance mods with broken or missing assets *before* you build a patch around them. Press **Scan** and N.P.C.2 walks every installed appearance mod's NPCs — no rendering involved — checking the files the game engine actually reads:

* **Missing FaceGen mesh / tint** — the NPC's baked head `.nif` or face tint `.dds` can't be found in the mod, the vanilla archives, or your Data folder (the classic dark-face/no-head setup). Templated NPCs and races that don't use FaceGen are correctly exempt.
* **Dark-face mismatch** — the FaceGen file exists, but the head parts baked into it don't match what the mod's own records ask for (wrong plugin version, mismatched files, and similar), which dark-faces in game even though every file is present. The check reads the mod's own plugins (falling back to the game's base records), never whatever happens to win your load order — so a verdict describes the mod itself, not your current setup. A FaceGen file that exists but can't be parsed (corrupt download, bad export) is reported the same way; character-creation presets and the Player record are skipped entirely (they never render in game — the race menu builds preset faces from morph data, not FaceGen); and NPCs with the ghost keyword get quieter *notes*, since the ghost visual effect usually hides face-tint problems.
* **Missing required mod** — the mod's records use head parts from a plugin that isn't in its folders and can't be resolved at all (a hard requirement like an eye or hair resource mod that isn't installed). One line per missing plugin instead of a wall of dark-face rows.
* **Missing meshes** — a body/skin or outfit ArmorAddon model the engine would draw (including the NPC's effective outfit, leveled lists and runtime distributors included) doesn't resolve, along with missing `_0`/`_1` weight counterparts.
* **Missing textures** — a texture path baked inside a rendered NIF, or referenced by an AlternateTextures entry, resolves nowhere. These are the white/wireframe body parts and untextured outfit pieces. The scanner is slot-aware: it only checks slots the engine actually samples (the face-tint slot is engine-managed and never checked — the game derives that texture from the NPC's FormID, so junk or stale paths there are harmless), and a missing **diffuse or normal map** is reported as an *issue* while missing secondary maps (specular, environment, subsurface — which even vanilla meshes reference without shipping) are quieter *notes*, hidden behind the **Show notes** toggle.
* **Out-of-scope assets** *(notes)* — an asset the mod references resolves fine, but from your **data folder** (a loose file or another mod's archive) rather than the mod's own Corresponding Mod Folders, and it isn't base-game content. Nothing is broken today; it's a *keep-that-mod-activated* dependency — the same class the blue treasure-chest badge flags on mugshot tiles, except the scan has time the renderer doesn't, so it also **cross-references your Mods folder and names the installed mod(s) actually shipping each file** (the **Provided By** column). To make such an asset travel with the mod instead, add the supplying mod's folder to the mod entry's Corresponding Mod Folders.

A couple of reading tips. **Outfit-category issues usually belong to the outfit or armor mod, not to the appearance replacer you scanned** — replacers rarely ship outfits, they just reference whatever your load order supplies. The **Provided By** column names the installed mod that actually supplies the broken piece, so that's the mod page (and author) to check. If a finding is expected and you're fine with it, right-click the row and **ignore** it — the specific occurrence, the file across the whole mod, or (for files that recur everywhere, like vanilla's own mouth subsurface maps) the file across **all** mods. Ignored rows disappear from counts, badges and exports until you bring them back with **Show ignored** (where you can also un-ignore them). The same right-click menu copies the row's NPC identity — **Name, EditorID, load-order FormID, or FormKey** — for console testing and xEdit lookups, and each row's Details cell names the texture slot, the biped partition slot(s) the shape occupies, and the exact file (loose or BSA) the referencing mesh resolved from.

Mods that ship **several plugins** (a main .esp plus a USSEP-compatible variant, say) get the record-based checks — the dark-face class — graded **per plugin**: the same NPC can be broken in one plugin and fine in the other, and a single verdict would silently depend on which plugin you happen to have selected as that NPC's source. Plugins whose records are identical for an NPC collapse to one row labeled with both; where they differ you get one row per plugin, and the **Plugin** column (and a small caption line above the NPC's name on the mugshot) says which record was graded. When a sibling plugin grades clean, the row says so in a **green line right under the verdict's headline** — switching that NPC's source plugin avoids the bug without giving up the mod. Better yet, when a scan finishes and finds NPCs whose *currently selected* plugin is the broken one while a sibling is clean, N.P.C.2 pops a summary dialog (collapsible per mod) and offers to **switch them for you** — applying just changes each NPC's source-plugin selection (only the switched NPCs are quickly re-checked afterwards, not the whole mod), and any switch can be undone from the NPC's mugshot in the Mods tab. Plugins you've marked **resource-only** (Set Resource Plugins) can never be an NPC's source, so a mismatch carried only by resource-only plugins is reported as a quieter *note* — that record can't reach a patch through this mod — and resource-only plugins are never suggested as switch targets.

The display works like a filtered Mods tab: the left panel lists only mods with issues (with per-type counts), and clicking one shows mugshots of just the affected NPCs, each carrying the warning badge whose tooltip lists the specific missing files. From a tile you can jump to that NPC in the NPCs tab, and each row has a button to show the mod in the Mods tab. The results table is **grouped by file** by default — one row per distinct problem with an NPC count, since a single missing texture in a shared body mesh otherwise repeats for every NPC — and clicking a mugshot shows that NPC's individual rows (or untick *Group by file* for the flat list). The **Issue Type** dropdown narrows both the mod list and the tiles to one problem class, **Export CSV** dumps everything for spreadsheet triage (with `Severity`, `ProvidedBy` and `Ignored` columns at the end), and **Ctrl+Shift+C** clears the search filters here like everywhere else.

Results are cached to `ModIssuesCache.json` next to the executable, so the tab repopulates instantly on the next launch. **Scan** only re-examines mods whose files have changed since their last scan (rows that have drifted are marked as stale); **Rescan All** ignores the cache and starts fresh, and right-clicking a mod row rescans just that one. The searchable box next to the buttons picks what both of them cover: it defaults to **ALL**, and typing filters the mod list as you search — pick one mod to scan just it, or leave partial text to scan every mod whose name matches (useful for re-checking one mod you just fixed without paying for the rest). Eligible mods that have never been scanned are listed separately under the mod list — an empty list only means "no issues found in what was scanned". A scan takes a few minutes on a large library the first time — it runs in the background, so you can keep using the other tabs while it works — and later scans only pay for what changed.

**For mod authors:** the scanner makes a good pre-release check for a replacer — point N.P.C.2 at your staging folder, scan just your mod, and you'll catch misspelled texture paths, files you forgot to pack, weight-sibling gaps and FaceGen/plugin mismatches before your users do.

## Summary Menu

![Summary menu](docs/Screenshots/Summary/Summary_Menu.png)

The Summary tab is an at-a-glance overview of every NPC you’ve made a selection for, each shown as a mugshot labeled with the chosen source mod. Use **View Mode** to switch between **Gallery** (pictured) and **List**, filter by **NPC Group**, set the page size, and page through your choices. It’s the quickest way to sanity-check your whole setup before running the patcher.


## Run Menu

This is where you generate output. (The verification tools, **Validate Output** and **Analyze Masters**, live in the [Validate tab](#validate-menu).)

![Run menu / Environment Status](docs/Screenshots/Run/Environment_Status.png)

* **Run Patch Generation**: Applies your selections and writes the output plugin + assets to your output folder.
* **Patch NPCs In Group**: Choose whether to patch (or make `.bat` files for) **\<All NPCs\>** or one of the groups you defined in the NPCs tab.
* **Generate Spawn Bat**: Writes a `.bat` file that spawns the NPCs in the selected group, so you can line them up in-game and check that they look right.
* **Performance Logging**: Prints the per-batch performance report at the end of a run (and the detailed timings on a validation run). On by default. Turning it off skips the report entirely rather than just hiding it. Timing warnings about a specific slow NPC always show, since those point at a real problem.
* **Verbose Logging**: Produces a detailed log — recommended only for troubleshooting. Both this and Performance Logging are now remembered between sessions.
* **Environment Status**: Prints your current configuration and full load order into the output pane (pictured). If you’re asking for help, copy this into a PasteBin and share the link.

The log pane itself is colour-coded by severity — warnings in yellow, errors in red, and successfully written files in green — so problems are findable in a long run without reading every line. Warnings and errors always appear regardless of the Verbose setting. Long lines wrap instead of running off the edge, the view sticks to the bottom as new output arrives but stops fighting you the moment you scroll back, and you can select lines and copy them with **Ctrl+C** or the right-click menu (click and drag to sweep a range). Selection is by whole line rather than by character.

### Validation Prompt

When you run patch generation, N.P.C.2 **first** checks that every selected mod is actually installed and provides the NPC you chose it for. Any selections that fail (mod missing, or NPC not in the mod) are shown in a dialog — grouped by *reason*, then by mod, so fifty NPCs skipped for the same cause read as one entry rather than fifty — and you’re asked whether to abort, or skip those NPCs and continue with the valid selections. Screening warnings always appear in the log, whether or not Verbose Logging is on — a skipped selection is something you need to see.

One case worth knowing about in advance: **SkyPatcher mode cannot apply an appearance to a templated NPC** while [Templated NPCs](#output-settings) is set to *Use the template's appearance*. Such an NPC has no face of its own — the game resolves it through the template chain and draws the face at the end of it — so a SkyPatcher directive aimed at the NPC never reaches the record that renders, and the NPC dark-faces. Those selections are listed and skipped, and the fix is to set Templated NPCs to *Give each NPC its own copy* (globally, or just for the mod in question) so each NPC owns its face.

![Validator warning](docs/Screenshots/Run/Validator_Warning.png)

Once you continue, the patcher runs; the output pane reports progress and finishes with a performance summary, the saved plugin path, and asset-copy verification. Any per-NPC warnings the run produced are collected and repeated at the end, grouped by type with a short explanation of what each type means — so they can be read as a checklist instead of fished out of the scroll:

![Patching completed](docs/Screenshots/Run/Patching_Completed.png)

## Validate Menu

This tab holds the two verification tools: **Validate Output** and **Analyze Masters** (covered at the end of this section).

**Validate Output** inspects an *already-generated* output against your selections to confirm the deployed result really matches what you picked — invaluable when something in your load order might be overwriting N.P.C.2’s output.

> **Important — refresh your mod manager first.** Validation reads the output exactly as your mod manager deploys it, so the freshly-generated files must be present in the mod manager’s virtual file system. After generating output you need to: **(1)** close N.P.C.2; **(2)** in your mod manager, enable the output mod and its plugin(s) (if you didn’t already in a previous session); and **(3)** relaunch N.P.C.2 **through your mod manager**, so it rebuilds the virtual file system with the new output included. If you validate immediately after generating without doing this, the check runs against a stale virtual file system that doesn’t contain your latest output, and the results will be misleading. N.P.C.2 enforces this for you: clicking **Validate Output** after running the patcher in the same session pops a confirmation explaining exactly this, so you can’t stumble into a misleading report by accident.

First, choose whether to validate every NPC with a selection or a hand-picked subset:

![Validate output - choose NPCs](docs/Screenshots/Run/Validate_Output_Choose_NPCs.png)

Each finding is tagged with the check that produced it — **Selection** (the chosen mod is no longer configured, or the last run didn’t patch this NPC — see below), **Record** (the conflict-winning NPC record doesn’t match the selected mod, with a field-level diff), **Asset** (the deployed FaceGen mesh differs from the selected mod’s), **FaceGen** (the deployed `.nif` doesn’t agree with the head parts on the NPC’s record — the dark face bug), **SkyPatcher**, **Template**, and **Environment** — and names the **Winning Source** that overrode your intended appearance.

Validation also re-verifies the run's **out-of-scope asset dependencies** — referenced assets the run deliberately didn't copy (out-of-scope references, or a mod with *Copy Assets* off) and instead relies on your live setup to supply. Healthy dependencies appear as **Info** rows that **cross-reference your Mods folder to name the installed mod(s) supplying them** — the mods that must stay activated for the output to render correctly. If the contract has since broken, the row escalates and the attribution turns actionable: a missing/disabled dependency **master** is an *Error* (the output plugin won't load at all) naming the mod folder that ships the archive, and vanished **loose** dependencies are a grouped *Warning* that tells you which still-installed-but-inactive mod folder contains the missing files, so you know exactly what to re-enable.

Each row also carries the NPC's **FormKey** and its **FormID**, so you can paste either straight into xEdit or the console. You can select any run of cells — drag, or Ctrl/Shift-click — and press **Ctrl+C** (or right-click → *Copy selected cells*) to copy just those, which is usually quicker than exporting the whole table when you only want a FormID or two.

The **Error / Warning / Info** checkboxes beside the filter box control which severities the table shows. **Info is unchecked by default**: those rows are context rather than problems, and leaving them on would bury the findings you opened the window for. The summary line above always counts all three, so you can see at a glance that rows are being hidden. Note that **Save CSV always writes every row**, including the hidden ones — the saved file is meant to be a complete record. **Copy TSV** copies what’s currently on screen.

![Validate output - results](docs/Screenshots/Run/Validate_Outputs_Results.png)

(The example above is a deliberately contrived setup — an “Ordinary People” overhaul placed so it wins conflicts over N.P.C.2’s output — to demonstrate what each finding looks like:)

![Contrived demo load order](docs/Screenshots/Run/Validate_Output_Demo_Situation_Contrived.png)

### “Not patched” findings

The NPC list you validate comes from your *current* selections, but a run doesn’t necessarily patch all of them: a selection can be dropped by the pre-run screening (you’re shown the list and asked whether to continue), and the patcher deliberately leaves an NPC alone when assembling its face would have caused the dark face bug. For those NPCs nothing of N.P.C.2’s is in your game at all, and grading them against your selection would report a mismatch the app didn’t cause and can’t fix.

So the validator checks first whether the last run actually covered each NPC, using the `NPC_Token.json` ledger that ships alongside your output:

* **Not patched** — an **Info** row (hidden unless you tick *Info*), naming the recorded reason it was skipped. Nothing is wrong with your output; this NPC simply isn’t part of it, and its appearance is whatever your load order already supplies. The rest of the checks are skipped for it.
* **Selection changed after the last run** — a **warning**, because unlike the above you’ve had no notice of it. You picked a different mod for this NPC since you last generated output, so the deployed result is stale. Re-run the patcher.

If `NPC_Token.json` is missing or lists no NPCs — an older output, or a run that was interrupted before it finished — the validator says so in the notes and grades everything as before, rather than claiming your whole output is missing.

### NPCs that inherit someone else’s face

Skyrim lets an NPC borrow another NPC’s appearance outright, via the **Traits** template flag — the game never loads that NPC’s own head parts or FaceGen at all. Lots of generic NPCs work this way. The validator follows those chains, so it checks the face the NPC *actually renders* rather than files the game never touches.

Most of the time this is invisible: if the NPC it inherits from carries the same mod you selected, the inherited face **is** the one you chose, and no row is emitted. You’ll only see a **Template** finding when the inheritance changes what you get — the template has a different selection, or none at all — and the row tells you which NPC to make your selection on instead. Chains the validator can’t follow (a leveled-NPC template, a missing record, a loop) are reported with the reason rather than guessed at.

This all depends on your [Templated NPCs](#output-settings) setting, and the validator respects it. Under *Give each NPC its own copy* the NPC owns its own face, so the redirect doesn’t apply and you won’t be told your selection was ignored — because it wasn’t.

### “No FaceGen” findings

Two findings concern an NPC that has no face mesh, and they mean opposite things:

* An **Info** row saying the selected mod ships no FaceGen for this NPC is *not* a problem. It's the patcher's designed behavior: when the chosen mod changes an NPC's face records but ships no mesh of its own, N.P.C.2 forwards a suitable one, and the row names what actually supplied it.
* A **warning** that there's no FaceGen *anywhere* is a real finding — usually a missing master. It's deliberately narrow, and excludes everything that legitimately has no face of its own: NPCs still inheriting through a template, races without the FaceGen Head flag, and records with no head parts at all.

### Reading FaceGen findings

A **FaceGen** finding means the deployed `.nif` and the NPC’s head parts don’t agree, which is what produces the dark face bug in game. The message tries to name the *likely cause* rather than just the symptom, because the fix is completely different depending on which it is: one head part out of step usually means a slightly different version of the appearance mod, whereas a wholesale disagreement almost always means a conflict was lost — either another plugin’s NPC record won, or another mod’s FaceGen file overwrote yours. The remedies given are specific to whichever case it detected.

One thing it deliberately stays quiet about: a `.nif` that contains *extra* shapes with no matching head part is not reported, because that doesn’t cause the bug. (Verified both in game and against the reference detector for this problem, the Dark Face Issue Reporter xEdit script, which likewise only checks that every head part on the record is present in the mesh.)

### Analyze Masters

The **Analyze Masters** tool explains *why* your output plugin depends on each of its masters. Pick which masters to analyze:

![Analyze masters - choose plugins](docs/Screenshots/Run/Analuze_Masters_Choose_Plugins.png)

The report lists every record in your output that still references the chosen master, and the exact field doing the referencing — so you can decide whether that master is one you actually want to keep:

![Analyze masters - results](docs/Screenshots/Run/Analuze_Masters_Results.png)

The screenshots use a deliberately contrived example. Here *Karura's Ordinary People.esp* has been left **active** in the load order as the conflict-winning override for Gianna, with the patcher in **Create and Patch** mode. The patcher therefore applies the selected appearance (from *A Rose in the Snow*) on top of Gianna's winning record — which is Karura's. Because Karura's gives Gianna a brand-new Default Outfit record, that outfit is pulled along, and the output ends up inheriting Karura's as a master. Analyze Masters surfaces exactly that dependency, and you can confirm it by hand in xEdit/SSEEdit:

![Analyze masters - SSEEdit verification](docs/Screenshots/Run/Analuze_Masters_SSEedit_Verification.png)

> **Tip:** this is exactly why I usually recommend leaving your appearance overhauls **disabled** in your load order. N.P.C.2 can fish all the data and assets it needs out of disabled mods, so a disabled overhaul won't sneak in as a master dependency the way an active conflict-winning override can.

# FAQ

**Q: Where do I get Mugshots?**

A: I like [Natural Lighting Mugshots](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/97595) the best. Other sources include [EasyNPC Mugshot Collection](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/99546), [Modpocalypse mugshots](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/103837), and the EasyNPC Discord channel. You can also have N.P.C.2 generate mugshots itself — see [Mugshot Settings](#mugshot-settings).

**Q: A mod I want to preview doesn’t have mugshots. What can I do?**

A: Turn on **Auto-Generate missing mugshots** (to render them from the mod’s own data) and/or **Use FaceFinder API for missing mugshots** (to download them) in the Mugshot Settings section. You can tune the renderer’s lighting and framing via **Show Preview**, then batch-generate for your whole list.

**Q: How do I migrate from/to EasyNPC?**

A: Go to the Settings tab and scroll down to the EasyNPC Transfer section, and click either the Import or Export button.

**Q: For EasyNPC Export, what’s the difference between Export to New vs. Update Existing?**

A: Export To New will assign new Default Plugins based on your load order, while Update Existing will keep the ones in the file that you’re updating and only change the appearance plugin.

**Q: What’s the difference between “Create” and “Create & Patch”?**

A: *Create* splices together your selections into a mod, but doesn’t consider your load order - the resulting plugin will look exactly as if you took the NPCs from your selected mods and stitched them together. You then have to do the conflict patching yourself, or use Synthesis FaceFixer to do it automatically. *Create and Patch* does both things for you, and actually patches your load order to use your selected appearance mods (similar to EasyNPC). In both cases, the N.P.C.2 output assets (textures and meshes) should win all conflicts, but in *Create* mode the plugin should go as high as possible in your load order (and then you or FaceFixer patch the conflicts) while in *Create and Patch* the generated file should only be overwritten by other patcher outputs.

**Q: What’s “Record Override Handling Mode” and when should I use it?**

A: A very small number of appearance mods make changes within records that aren’t typically associated with appearance replacers (e.g. modifying Race records), and don’t work correctly without these modifications. If you set the handling mode to “Include” or “Include as New”, N.P.C.2 will forward these changes into the output. Doing so for all NPCs slows down the patcher quite a bit (and in some cases can crash it) so only use this for the plugins that need it. An example of such a plugin is RS Children.

**Q: For the Handling Mode, what’s the difference between “Include” vs. “Include as New”?**

A: When record overrides are detected, the patcher will handle them in one of three ways:

1. If the Handling Mode is Include As New, the override records will be copied into new records, and any references to them from the NPC will be remapped to these new records. This avoids conflicts with other mods that might reference those records, but by the same token you lose the effects of any mods that touched the original record. The same isolation applies to the copies' asset files: any mesh or texture a copied record uses that the appearance mod itself ships is delivered to a private `NPC2\<mod name>` folder (with the copy re-pointed at it) instead of the file's original path, so the mod's replacement assets reach only the NPCs assigned to it rather than overwriting the shared file for the whole game. This also means outfits reached through an NPC's Default Outfit are delivered even when "Include Outfits" is off — repointing the NPC at the mod's private copy of the outfit it already wears is not the same as changing which outfit it wears.
2. If Handling Mode is “Include” and Patching Mode is “Create and Patch”, the patcher will compare the override record to its base record, note the changes, and patch them into your conflict-winning version of that record (this is similar in a way to how Mator Smash works). Note that this is an automated and unsupervised process, so you may want to check the output in xEdit and make sure everything was handled correctly.
3. If Handling Mode is “Include” and Patching Mode is “Create”, the overrides will just be copied in directly from the source mods. Conflict resolution with other mods that touch these records will be on you.

The option to choose depends on your needs. If you’re comfortable in xEdit, the safest option is always “Create” because then you just do the conflict resolution yourself, but obviously that’ll get tedious to do whenever you rebuild an NPC merge. “Include” mode is good if you’re comfortable enough in xEdit to take a quick look and make sure the changes forwarded from the appearance mod make sense. “Include as new” may be necessary if you have multiple appearance mod that override the same record in different ways - this will allow you to separate them and use both versions of that record.

As a reminder, this is getting in the weeds and for the vast majority of appearance replacers, you shouldn’t need to override non-appearance records at all.

**Q: How do I check that my output actually came out right?**

A: Use the **Validate** tab. It compares the deployed result against your selections and flags any NPC whose record or FaceGen mesh doesn’t match what you chose (and tells you which plugin won the conflict). **Analyze Masters** complements it by showing why your output depends on each master.

For an in-game spot check, you can also use **Generate Spawn Bat** (Run tab) to spawn a Group of NPCs in front of you and eyeball them. Make a small Group for this — e.g. one NPC of each race + gender — rather than using `<All NPCs>`: a spawn bat for the entire list tries to summon thousands of NPCs at once and will crash anything short of a supercomputer.

**Q: Why is NPC2 connecting to the internet? Is this spyware?**

A: This is the Description Provider connecting to UESP or The Elder Scrolls Wiki to source the description of the NPC you’re looking at (and, if enabled, FaceFinder fetching mugshots). You can disable the descriptions by unchecking “Show NPC Descriptions”, and FaceFinder is off unless you enable it.

**Q: How do NPC Descriptions work for mod-added NPCs that aren’t in UESP?**

A: By default, N.P.C.2 just won’t show descriptions for those NPCs. If you want to add them, you can go the the DescriptionOverrides folder (found in the same folder as the N.P.C.2 .exe file) and create a .json file containing descriptions for the new NPCs. You can find an example in the ExampleOverride.json file in that directory.

Before writing your own, check whether someone has already done the work — community-made description files are available online, such as [NPC Descriptions for NPC Plugin Chooser 2](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/157339). And if you do write descriptions for a mod that isn’t covered yet, please consider sharing them so others can benefit — and try to keep them spoiler-free, since people read these to decide an appearance without necessarily knowing the character yet.

**Q: Can N.P.C.2 handle facegen-only mods like Nordic Faces that don’t come with a plugin?**

A: Yes. It’ll use the base plugin for those NPCs for conflict patching.

This also works for *mixed* mods — ones whose plugin covers some NPCs while other NPCs only ship FaceGen files. The record-less NPCs are offered like any other appearance, marked with a warning icon in the gallery explaining that their record will be inherited from the NPC’s original plugin with just the mod’s face mesh/textures applied (so if the mod’s FaceGen was built against different head parts, the face may mismatch in game).

**Q: An NPC’s hair disappears in game when they change clothes. What’s going on?**

A: That mod is giving them a **wig** — hair implemented as an armor worn in the hair slot rather than as a normal head part — and the wig went away with the outfit. Set that mod’s **Wig Handling Mode** (Mods tab, or the global default under Settings → Output Settings → [Head Editing](#head-editing-wigs--antlers)) to *Forward To Skin*, which is the default and moves the wig into the NPC’s skin so it survives outfit changes. If you want the wig to behave like real hair in every respect — surviving outfit changes *and* being hidden by helmets — try the experimental *Convert To Headparts* mode, which bakes the wig into the FaceGen.

**Q: Every NPC from this mod has black hair in the mugshot gallery. Is the mod broken?**

A: No — those are wigs with a placeholder hair color, waiting for RaceMenu to recolor them at runtime (High Poly NPC Overhaul is the well-known example). Turn on **Preview worn wigs the way RaceMenu tints them** in Settings → Output Settings → Head Editing, which is on by default, and the gallery will show them the way they look in game with RaceMenu installed. If you *don’t* use RaceMenu, leave it off — the black hair is then an accurate preview of what you’ll actually get. See [Why converted wigs need a hair color](#why-converted-wigs-need-a-hair-color).

**Q: Convert To Headparts is marked experimental. What’s the risk?**

A: It rewrites the NPC’s FaceGen mesh, which is the one operation where a mistake shows up as the dark face bug. It works in my testing, including on HDT-SMP wigs, and it falls back to the ordinary wig forwarding whenever a bake looks unsafe — but please spawn the affected NPCs and check them before committing to it for a whole mod. Reports are welcome; no promises.

**Q: How do I get rid of the antlers/horns a mod adds?**

A: Set that mod’s **Antler Handling Mode** to *Remove*. That reaches antlers in the NPC’s outfit, antlers baked into their worn armor, and antlers that are FaceGen head parts. If a particular set survives, it’s probably a head part whose name doesn’t contain an antler keyword, so the scan missed it — open the NPC’s 3D preview, click **Set Antler Head Parts**, hover the rows until the antlers light up in the viewport, and check that row. (The one case *Remove* can’t reach is antlers baked into an outfit your own load order owns, which N.P.C.2 isn’t forwarding.)

**Q: Why can’t I see {some NPC} from {some mod}?**

A: Open **Settings > Mod Import Settings > [Rejected NPCs](#mod-import-settings)** and type the NPC’s name (or EditorID / FormKey) into the filter box — it will tell you which mods discarded that NPC and why. The same information is in the raw `Rejected NPCs` subfolder next to the main .exe file, one log per mod.

If the reason concerns the **FaceGen Head flag**, that’s N.P.C.2 concluding the NPC has no customizable face. It judges that from the *race* record’s “FaceGen Head” flag — the game’s own signal for whether an actor gets a built head — rather than from the `ActorTypeNPC` keyword, and it reads it from the end of the NPC’s template chain rather than from the NPC’s own record (a templated NPC’s own race field is inert, which is why the vanilla data leaves junk in it).

The practical effect is that humanoid-shaped automatons, skeletons and monsters no longer clutter the list. Mod authors quite correctly tag those with `ActorTypeNPC` so they behave like people in combat and dialogue, but there’s no face underneath — loot the helmet off one of Clockwork’s Gilded and there’s nothing there, despite all 175 of them shipping FaceGen files. (Shipped FaceGen proves nothing either way: the Creation Kit auto-exports it for any actor, headless or not.) It also works in the other direction, adding NPCs the old keyword rule wrongly excluded — **Miraak** being the notable one. If you’re upgrading and had already picked appearances for NPCs that are no longer offered, N.P.C.2 lists them for you once on first launch.

**Q: The NPCs menu only shows me vanilla NPCs, but my appearance mods are clearly there. What happened?**

A: Look at the Environment Status in the Settings tab. If it says **Valid (no mod plugins found)** in amber, N.P.C.2 is reading the Skyrim launcher’s load order instead of your mod manager’s, which means it can only see base-game and Creation Club NPCs. Relaunch it through your mod manager — see [“Valid (no mod plugins found)”](#valid-no-mod-plugins-found).

**Q: The validator says an NPC “inherits its appearance” and tells me to select a different NPC. Why can’t I just select this one?**

A: Because the game will ignore your choice. That NPC has the **Traits** template flag set, which means it renders another NPC’s face entirely — it never loads its own head parts or FaceGen. Whatever you pick for it is dead weight. Make your selection on the NPC the row names instead, and this one will follow along.

**Q: My appearance mod is mastered to another mod. How do I get that mod to also be merged into the output patch rather than the output patch being mastered to it?**

A: Go to the Mods tab, find your mod, and add the master mod to its Corresponding Mod Folder Paths.

**Q: N.P.C.2 is deciding that my mod is not an appearance mod. Why?**

A: Either it is missing a master and thus can’t be analyzed, or it doesn’t add any new NPCs or modify facial features of existing ones. If it’s missing a master, go to the Settings tab, scroll down to the Non-Appearance Mods list, find your mod, and remove it. Then close N.P.C.2, enable the missing master, and relaunch.

**Q: My NPC Groups dropdown box is empty. How do I add a group?**

A: Type your desired group name in the box and click Add Current or Add Visible to get it started with either your currently selected NPC or all NPCs visible in the sidebar with your current filter settings.

**Q: I’m trying to add some mod (say, Children of the Hist) and I’m getting missing masters error for a mod that I don’t have in my load order (example: Better Argonian Horns). What do I do?**

A: Children of the Hist needs Better Argonian Horns as a master. If you for some reason don’t want Better Argonian Horns in your load order, install it, keep it disabled, and add the installation folder as one of the Corresponding Mod Folder Paths for Children of the Hist.

**Q: Can you add X feature?**

A: Feel free to pitch ideas, but know that I’ll be pretty selective about what I implement, and I’m likely to only act on low-hanging fruit. I have limited bandwidth for modding and several projects on the go, so I’ll only take on requests that are fast and easy to implement.

**Q: Why is this tagged as AI generated?**

A: Because I used LLMs (mostly Gemini, and also ChatGPT) to write some of the code.

**Q: So is this all AI Slop? Can I trust it?**

A: I primarily used the AI to make the UI, because that part of the process requires a lot of boilerplate code and isn’t particularly fun. For the part that actually interacts with Skyrim data, I took my code from N.P.C.1 and fed it to Gemini, asking to hook it up to the buttons and new data structure from N.P.C.2. I ended up having to rewrite the vast majority of that code myself, and checked over all of it. If there are any bugs attributable to using an LLM, they’ll be in the UI - any bugs in the Skyrim-facing code are of my own making.

**Q: What are the permissions?**

A: Open permissions to the extent allowed by the tools that were used to make this. If you want to modify it, I’d appreciate a Git PR just to keep things centralized and avoid having multiple branches but if you message me and I don’t response for more than a couple weeks, assume I’ve moved on and feel free to launch your own fork.

**Q: Do you accept donations?**

A: Nope, this is a passion project. If you would otherwise send a donation my way, please consider instead supporting humanitarian organizations in Ukraine such as [United24](https://u24.gov.ua/donate), which is where I would forward the money anyway.

**So, how was the vibe coding?**

Good and bad. LLMs have definitely come a long was since the launch of ChatGPT. There’s very much a tier list. I only used ChatGPT and Gemini for this project (I have paid subscriptions to both) and I confidently say that for managing anything more than the simplest program, Gemini is far superior due to its massive context window. ChatGPT can barely remember multiple functions, while Gemini can consider a large multi-file project. ChatGPT is a bit better at troubleshooting specific functionalities because it’s more to the point; Gemini likes to add its own twist on things (unasked) and strips out comments, and sometimes ignores direct requests, but for large projects ChatGPT just doesn’t have the context window (as of August 1 2025) to analyze and provide helpful output.

Overall, Gemini was great for coding the UI and more or less did exactly what I asked. There was one functionality (the mugshot drag and drop) for which it provided the wrong strategy and I spent 4 or 5 nights troubleshooting/arguing with it before giving up, thinking it through, and fixing it myself using an alternate strategy. Gemini was about to have me reinstall my OS because it was convinced I had a corrupted system. Otherwise, UI coding was largely flawless.

On the back end, where the coding was more specialized and required knowledge of the Mutagen API for Bethesda games, the changes Gemini made to my N.P.C.1 code were largely destructive, sometimes in ways that I didn’t realize until I started looking through its code in fine detail. Its code would usually compile with few or no fixes, but the changes it made resulted in horrible things like patching runs that took 4 hours, or startup initialization that ate 19 GB of RAM. Furthermore, once these behaviors were pointed out, the LLMs were pretty useless at fixing the behavior - every time they would suggest “this is happening because of X; here’s how to fix it…” and their fix would be completely wrong, so I’d always end up having to investigate and fix myself. In retrospect I could have saved at least a month by ditching the LLMs and coding the back end by hand (which, by the end, is largely what happened anyway).

Therefore, while the tools were genuinely helpful (and I don’t think I would have ever launched the project without their help, as after SynthEBD I never want to code another UI unassisted), I really don’t buy the hype about how they’re going to put most programmers out of work. They’re a productivity aid, not a replacement.

**Update:** since the initial release, I’ve polished the project considerably using Claude and Claude Code. It still took a lot of manual validation, but it was significantly faster and more successful than my earlier experience, and it let me take on ambitious modules — like the in-app mugshot renderer — that would have been very difficult for me to write on my own.
